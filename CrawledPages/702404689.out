Give Now!Welcome to the Department of Hispanic Studies at the University of California, Riverside. We are a diverse department of scholars and teachers whose primary goal is to explore with our students the rich and varied languages, literatures, and cultures of the Hispanic World. We offer a Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral degree in Spanish for those students seeking undergraduate or advanced study, and we also provide the opportunity for students to study abroad in a Spanish or Portuguese-speaking country.Equally important, we train students to think critically in an increasingly global community and to perceive complexity, similarity, and divergence in cultures from many points of view. Our task is deeply rooted in the liberal arts tradition, and our graduates pursue careers in all walks of life.For more information about our undergraduate and graduate programs, our faculty, education abroad opportunities, and our Spanish language courses, please click on the appropriate links.For questions or queries about graduate study in Spanish, contact the Graduate Advisor about academic content (Professor Benjamin Liu, benjamin.liu@ucr.edu) or the Graduate Student Affairs Assistant regarding admissions (Nicole Bogner, nicole.bogner@ucr.edu).?Department of Hispanic Studies University of California, Riverside 2401 HMNSS Building Riverside, California 92521?
