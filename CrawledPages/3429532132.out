Search for:?Our goal is to lead research efforts in several subfields of physics and astronomy and to infuse that research into undergraduate and graduate education. We seek greater understanding of the origin and structure of the universe, and the basic interactions that govern it. We study condensed matter and biological systems, both at microscopic and macroscopic scales, with an eye on their potential practical applications. In doing so, we seek to provide the nucleus of interaction between materials, biological, and environmental science and engineering researchers at UCR.Graduate Program?????????? Undergraduate ProgramUC Riverside-led research shows the galaxies are the faintest and most numerous ever seen in the early universeBy Iqbal Pittalwala on January 7, 2014An image taken with the Hubble Space Telescope of Abell 1689, a massive cluster of galaxies whose gravitational pull is so strong that it bends light, acting like a lens. This Åggravitational lensÅh magnifies galaxies behind the cluster, making them appear far brighter than they would if the foreground cluster of galaxies were not there. The galaxies discovered in this study (circled) are magnified by factors of 3-100 and are fainter than any galaxies seen at this distance before. These previously unseen distant galaxies are so numerous that they are likely producing the majority of stars formed in the early universe. Zoomed in images of many of the galaxies are shown on the right. The galaxies are very compact (diameters 1/30th ? 1/100th the size of our own Milky Way galaxy) and very blue, meaning they have recently formed many new stars.

A team of scientists led by astronomers at the University of California, Riverside has used NASAÅfs Hubble Space Telescope to uncover the long-suspected underlying population of galaxies that produced the bulk of new stars during the universeÅfs early years.The galaxies are the smallest, faintest, and most numerous galaxies ever seen in the remote universe, and were captured by Hubble deep exposures taken in ultraviolet light.UC Riverside Astronomers Help Discover the Most Distant Known Galaxy?

The project seeks to uncover new physics that will help to complete the Standard Model of physics, a comprehensive theory that explains the interactions between all fundamental elementary particles, accounting for most measurements to date.ÅgBasically, we collide protons together and create new particles,Åh explained John Ellison, a professor of physics and astronomy and collaborator on the CMS project, ÅgThen we look for new physics that arise from those conditions.ÅhCMS research has already led to the discovery of the Higgs boson earlier this year, and in the future may lead to future evidence for supersymmetry, heavy neutrinos, and extra-spatial dimensions. The CMS pixel detector is essential for such research.Gail Hanson, a distinguished professor of physics and astronomy and team leader of the project gave details on the repairs. ÅgWe are currently in a shut-down period to allow for magnet upgrades that will allow the LHC to achieve its final design energy,Åh she said. ÅgThat has provided us with the opportunity to work on the detector.ÅhFormer UCR postdoc?Arkady Shekhter and his colleagues at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Los Alamos National Laboratory have discivered the thermodynamic signature of a phase transition to the so-called pseudogap state? found in a large region of the phase diagram of high-temperature cuprate superconductors. It is believed that the nature of this state holds the key to understanding the mechanism behind the high-temperature superconductivity. This new finding is consistent with the theory pioneered by Prof. Chandra Varma.

As further evidence of her passion for teaching, she is actively engaged in outreach at the K-12 level. In addition to wide-ranging public lectures, she is principal investigator of the Inland Area Science Program, a collaboration between UNEX, several UCR teaching programs, and local school districts, which has raised funds for teacher-training in the sciences. She lectures and mentors students in the AVID and SACNAS programs in California and beyond. She spends several weeks every summer teaching English and science in an orphanage in Africa.Over the past 7 years, Lau has mentored eight undergraduate students, with several students training in her laboratory for at least two years. Five of these students have graduated and gone on to pursue doctoral degrees. Under her guidance, these students have received several grants. Her studentsÅf success is due in part to her close attention to their professional training and access to publication opportunities in top journals.
