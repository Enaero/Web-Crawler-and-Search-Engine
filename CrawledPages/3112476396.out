skip to main contentThe Ohio State UniversityOffice of Academic AffairsThe Ohio State University will be consistently recognized among the top ten public comprehensive research universities in the world.To achieve this goal, Ohio State is following a planning path that engages all members of its community. Every college and support unit?in collaboration with its constituents?has developed a strategic plan to prioritize objectives and guide decision-making. All are founded in the overarching principles of Ohio StateÅfs vision, mission, and values.Strategic planning builds commitment to a shared vision by identifying points of progress and establishing the metrics to measure that progress. All strategic planning at Ohio State is guided by ten principles that ensure that the universityÅfs planning effort remains continually vital, sustainable, and accountable.Because Ohio StateÅfs vision, mission, and values are touchstones for all of the universityÅfs strategic plans, and since they are shaped by the same guiding principles, all our strategic plans support and sustain each other. Their integrated nature is evidence of the collegesÅf and support unitsÅf commitment to a One University ethic.In that same One University spirit, Ohio StateÅfs central administration empowers and facilitates the implementation of the strategic plans. To do so, central administration has committed to strategic investment over the coming ten years in faculty, students, and facilities to support their success.To learn more about strategic planning, please see Executive?Vice President and Provost Joseph A.
