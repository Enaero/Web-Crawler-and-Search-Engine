Search for:The Graduate Program of Plant Pathology at the University of California, Riverside aims at conducting research on the basic biology of plant pathogens; developing methods for the management of plant diseases; providing a quality education to its students; and, providing expert advice on plant diseases to the citizens of California and the world. Plant pathology is a multidisciplinary field and consequently represented among our faculty are experts in the fields of genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, and chemistry, as well as the more traditional aspects of disease control. Thus, some of our faculty are exploiting novel genomics-based approaches to the study of plant pathology. World-class, federally to regionally and statewide-funded research is being conducted by our faculty with research subjects ranging from gene identification, function, and manipulation to proteomics and biochemistry. Research programs range from those based primarily in the laboratory to those with both laboratory and substantial field programs. Many faculty also have close interactions with growers and farm advisors throughout California and the world. This is critical to applied research for identifying new and common plant diseases and developing innovative management programs based on ecological and epidemiological approaches including molecular epidemiology. The Plant Pathology Graduate Programs is a key component to the Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology. Many graduate students have been attracted to Riverside by the international reputation of our Department. The Department is large enough to provide graduate students with the experience and skills needed to make them successful in scientific endeavors, but small enough for them to form close, personal relationships with their professors and colleagues. As a consequence of the multidisciplinary approaches used for this goal, graduate students in the Department have the opportunity to learn about a broad range of disciplines including molecular and classical genetics, biochemistry, botany, and disease diagnosis. Graduates may find themselves working for large agribusiness firms developing new fungicides, biotechnology firms creating disease-resistant plants through genetic engineering, universities developing tomorrow's agricultural technology or studying how microorganisms cause diseases, or at governmental agencies or private organizations providing practical advice on controlling disease.
