ÅgThe academic opportunity, quality of the people and the spirit of The Ohio State University is something that really extends through all four corners of the state.ÅhOhio StateÅfs Board of Trustees appointed Drake as the universityÅfs next president on Thursday, January 30.

He joined the faculty at the University of California, San Francisco in the late 1970s and rose through the ranks, serving for five years as vice president for health affairs for the UC system, overseeing academic program policy at UCÅfs 15 health sciences schools, located on seven campuses.As chancellor, Drake has been responsible for substantial increases in the institutionÅfs academic breadth and reach. He oversaw the creation of the first new public law school in California in more than 40 years, and successfully led the launch of several new programs in public health, pharmaceutical sciences and nursing science. The UC Irvine School of Education also was established under his leadership.The New York City native already has a fondness for Ohio, as his mother grew up in Youngstown, and he would visit the state often as a child. Now, he and his wife are thrilled to start a new chapter of their lives in the Buckeye state.ÅgThere is no more impactful university in the United States and in many ways in the world,Åh Drake says. ÅgIt is the center of the country, in many ways kind of at the heart of the country. It represents the land-grant research public universities ? that is one of the things that makes this country so great. Åc The chance to be associated with such an institution is something that is just a wonderful opportunity.ÅhFollow this feature on Twitter using #OSUnewprez? 2014 | Student Academic Services Building | 281 W.
