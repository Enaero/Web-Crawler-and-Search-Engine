Establishing a budget permits you to identify what your monthly or quarterly income will be and what your anticipated expenses are. If your expenses are greater than your resources, you will need to look at options for cutting your costs or supplementing your income. Suggestions may include getting a part-time job during the school year or a summer job, sharing expenses with one or more roommates, finding an apartment with lower rent, conserving on utilities, limiting the amount that you eat out, and spending less on clothes, personal costs, and entertainment. Plan a budget to ensure you have enough money to pay for tuition/fees, housing, food and other personal expenses.Get an estimate of your financial aid award should you choose to enroll at UC Riverside.
