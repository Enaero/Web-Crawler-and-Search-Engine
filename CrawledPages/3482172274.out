Employer participants include business, industry, non-profit organizations and government agencies. Positions are generally entry-level in nature and encompass a broad range of functional areas, including, but not limited to: finance, marketing, management, sales, operations, social service, technology, engineering and laboratories.Undergraduate and graduate students from all academic departments graduating this academic year in December, March or June are eligible. Each employer determines specific qualifications and application process. Occasionally, some internship opportunities exist for students not yet ready to graduate.Open schedules are first-come, first-served. Eligible students who meet the employer's requirements submit an online resume and sign up for a specific time slot. Pre-select schedules allow all students that meets the employer's requirements to submit an on-line resume. The employer will review the submitted resumes and "preselect" those students who will be invited for an interview. Other schedules allow employers to fill their own schedules from career fairs or information sessions, and occasionally an employer may?conduct employers utilzing Skypes or other conferencing options.??To be the most competitive, students are highly encouraged to attend a Interviewing Skills Workshop or Yikes!
