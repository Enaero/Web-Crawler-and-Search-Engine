Search for:The University of California, Riverside (UCR) is one of 10 universities within the prestigious University of California system, and the only UC located in Inland Southern California. To convey an image consistent with who we are and to communicate effectively with many diverse constituents and key stakeholders, UCR has established a unified institutional brand and marketing program.The goal of unified branding, as described in this manual and instituted through the integrated marketing program, is to represent our shared identity through an easily-remembered positive public image. A consistent, unified brand significantly enhances the coordination of our campus communications efforts, conveying a professional and positive image to our valued constituencies. A unified brand that is attractive and well represents our institution is more effective at competing in a crowded marketplace for new students, faculty and funding resources.The UC Riverside Identity Standards Manual, sometimes referred to as the "style guide", was developed by the UCR Office of Strategic Communications in conjunction with stakeholders and senior management across campus. This manual is the official reference and provides guidelines for all campus colleges, departments and units, and is intended to help anyone who writes, edits or designs printed, electronic, or other publications and materials for and about UCR. Easy and economical to implement, the manual is useful for a variety of formats and applications, with a flexibility that allows campus units to retain their individuality and capitalize on the benefits of a unified UCR brand. Consistent use of this manual will ensure that UC and UCR policies and guidelines are being properly applied to official stationery, business cards, signage, university web sites, the seal, products, publications and collateral materials.| Logos and Best Practices
