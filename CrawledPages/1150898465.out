Today, engineering innovations are increasingly dependent on breakthroughs in materials at the micro- and nanometer scale. Students in MSE acquire a solid background in the basic sciences and in the engineering of materials, with hands-on laboratory experience in nano-scale materials characterization and processing. This program prepares graduates for a variety of careers in fields such as nanotechnology, electronics, computing, the biomedical, automotive and aerospace industries, as well as government agencies and research laboratories.Multiple fellowships are available for new MSE graduate student applicants!Bio-Templating: The M13 Filamentous Virus -- Bottom-up assembly techniques mimic processes in the natural world to arrange nanoscale components into larger scale structres. Such techniques are capable of precise assembly of devices on the nanometer scale, as well as building novel nanoscale or heterogeneous materials. The Haberer Lab uses the M13 filamentous virus, a biologically-based template, to assemble materials for electronic and optoelectronic applications from the bottom up.?News?Highlights?By creating nanoparticles with controlled shape, engineers believe smaller, more powerful and energy efficient batteries can be built. ?Researchers at the University of California, RiversideÅfs?Bourns College of Engineering?have redesigned the component materials of the battery in an environmentally friendly way to solve some of these problems. By creating nanoparticles with a controlled shape, they believe smaller, more powerful and energy efficient batteries can be built. By modifying the size and shape of battery components, they aim to reduce charge times as well.ÅgThis is a critical, fundamental step in improving the efficiency of these batteries,Åh said?David Kisailus, an associate professor of Materials Science and Engineering and lead researcher on the project. ?Link to UCR News?The annual rankings by Leiden University in the Netherlands ranked UC Riverside's programs in engineering and natural sciences 10th in the world, ahead of institutions such as Princeton, Yale, and Caltech. The Leiden rankings objectively measure scientific impact based on research citations and collaboration worldwide.Link to UCR News?Alexander Balandin co-edits and co-authors a chapter in the book about the novel synthetic materialA University of California, Riverside professor of Materials Science and Engineering has co-edited a book about innovative technologies using graphene.Alexander A.
