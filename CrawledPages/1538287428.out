Interacting directly with their graduate students, the faculty creates working environments for a wide variety of research areas.Be it bioethics, proteomics or plant cell pathology, the partnerships between faculty and students at CMDB keep them on the cutting edge of their fields.Structural biology ? like this 3D model of a protein receptor ? provides molecular insights into how the receptor and its ligand regulate gene transcription. CMDB faculty use this information to better understand the molecular basis for genetic diseases and to facilitate drug discovery.Whether it's neuroscience, cellular chemistry, bioinformatics or bio-nondevices, our program pushes the edges of discovery.The Interdepartmental Cell, Molecular and Developmental Biology Graduate Program offers both Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees.The more-than 50 participating faculty members are recognized leaders in a variety of research areas. Collectively they provide research opportunities to graduate students in basic and applied cell, molecular and/or developmental biology, related to biomedical sciences and agricultural sciences.CMDB offers opportunities for research projects in the following areas of basic, applied, medical and agriculture sciences.Rachel Behar will study the effects of electronic cigarette aerosols on cell healthParticipating CMDB students have access to modern professorial laboratories as well as the 10,000-square-foot core instrumentation facility in Noel Keen Hall which provides state-of-the-art equipment, such as microscopy and imaging, bioinformatics, proteomics, including protein sequencing via mass spectrometry, DNA sequencing and cell sorting. One of the most advanced insectaries in the nation is also available for the study of invasive species and genetically-modified organism.
