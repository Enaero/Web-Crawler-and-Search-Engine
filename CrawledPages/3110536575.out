Our mission is to provide quality education, conduct strong research, foster close partnership with industry and government, and provide related service to the campus community and the community at large. The mission is guided by a commitment to continuous improvement in the overall quality of teaching, research, and service, while adhering to the highest standard of ethics. More?Through the support of AFOSR via the Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada (CICESE) a subcontract was granted in the amount of $24K to support a project entitled: ÅgLaser-induced patterning of transparent ceramics and metallic thin films for photonic and sensing applicationsÅh to Profs. Aguilar (PI) and Garay (co-PI). The aim was to continue ongoing studies to further understand the mechanisms by which femtosecond lasers pulses (200 fs) of ~5 nJ/pulse at 54MHz were sufficient to write waveguides on diverse YSZ samples. This subcontract entailed the elaboration of a thermal model to simulate the temperature evolution at the surface and within the YSZ samples under laser radiation. This model served to show that it is not a thermal mechanism but rather a photon-electron interaction that is responsible for the remarkably low energy needed for writing.?This three-year grant is for "Programmable Dynamic Self-Assembly of DNA Nanostructures"??The gift and contract is for research related to improved turbine blade cooling.??Omid received a best poster award, November 19, 2013, in the Micro and Nanotechnology Society-Wide Forum, 2013 ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE 2013), San Diego, CA, Nov. 15-21, 2013. Poster details: Characterization of fenestrated titanium microneedles for passive ocular drug delivery. Omid is advised by Assistant Professor Masaru P.

Tsai's research interests were in robotics, mechanisms and machine theory, design methodology, automotive engineering and microelectromechanical systems. The Tsai Memorial Award was established in his honor to support graduate students in mechanical engineering who make important contributions to their work using mechanical engineering design principles.?The Roberta Nichols Yakel Scholarship Fund was established in 2004 by Dr. Roberta Nichols Yakel, who was the first woman to be elected as a Fellow of the Society of Automotive Engineers, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the Society of Women Engineers, and a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Dr. Nichols-Yakel passed away in April 2005 at the age of 73. It was Dr. Nichols-Yakel wish to establish this fund to provide scholarship assistance for undergraduate students in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UCR, who are interested in pursuing a career in mechanical/automotive engineering. Every year the department chair and the undergraduate committee nominate a distinguished student who meets this criteria, and a personal plaque and a $500 gift are awarded.?Claire won a $3000 prize, on top of the $500 initiation grand she received in July. Claire is advised by Assistant Professor Elisa Franco (ME).?One of the current frontiers of biology is the creation of novel functions using molecular parts as if they were components of electrical or mechanical systems. This project focuses on building a molecular bistable circuit in vitro using synthetic RNA species. Bistable circuits are a fundamental component in electronic systems as well as in biological networks. Bistability is often observed in natural biological pathways, particularly in signal transduction and developmental networks. Artificial, simplified alternatives to natural bistable circuits may yield in the future tools to improve our ability to control signaling and development in cells. The approach includes experiments and numerical analysis.?http://nano.nd.edu/ndconnect2013.html?A team of UCR researchers, led by Prof. Guillermo Aguilar, have recently reported the development of novel, ceramic-based transparent cranial implants in the journal Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Medicine, and Biology, a leading journal in the field of nanomedicine. By providing a permanent window through which doctors can perform laser-based procedures, the team envisions potential for their implants to open new treatment options for patients with life-threatening neurological disorders, such as brain cancer and traumatic brain injury.Windows to the Brain team members, from left to right: Prof. Javier Garay (ME & MSE), Dr. Yasuhiro Kodera (ME), Ms. Carissa Reynolds (BIEN), Ms. Yasaman Damestani (BIEN), Prof. Guillermo Aguilar (ME), Prof. Masaru Rao (ME & MSE), and Prof. Hyle Park (BIEN).?Not shown: Prof. Devin Binder (SoM), Ms. Jenny Szu (SoM), and?Mr. Mike Hsu (SoM).

The project, which includes field studies and modeling, seeks to understand the factors that govern exposure to pollutants emitted by vehicles traveling on urban roads.?? Dr. Venkatram and his students are responsible for developing a dispersion model that can be used by urban and transportation planners to develop strategies to mitigate exposure to roadway emissions. The strategies include traffic management to reduce emissions and design of streets and buildings to reduce exposure to emissions.???The project, titled "Design and Synthesis of Robust and Tunable Nucleic Acid-Based Oscillators for Bionanotechnology", is a combination of computational and experimental efforts to generate tunable molecular clocks made with nucleic acids and proteins. These oscillators will potentially operate as timing devices for controlled large scale assembly or nanostructures, for nanofabrication, and for molecular computers.Prof. Elisa Franco?will receive a $30,000 grant to support her research project, ÅgDevelopment of reconfigurable nanoscale materials using nucleic acids,Åh which will investigate ways to create programmed materials that are able to adapt in response to stimuli much like living cells.Yasaman Damestani, Bioengineering (Mechanical Engineering Advisor: Prof. Guillermo Aguilar), Shannon Gott, Mechanical Engineering (Mechanical Engineering Advisor: Prof. Masaru P.

Ozkan, and co-workers report a new fluorescence quenching microscopy metrology technique that allows the identification of graphene layers and doped/undoped regions across a large graphene landscape by utilizing the fact that undoped regions of graphene quench fluorescence more than the doped regions through resonant energy transfer. Contrast differences in fluorescence across the graphene sheet reveal the complex ring-patterned doping. This metrology technique is well-suited for industrial, large-scale, pristine, and modified graphene sheet surface characterization.
