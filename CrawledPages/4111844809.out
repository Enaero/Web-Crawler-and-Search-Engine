The UCR MFA in Creative Writing and Writing for the Performing Arts (CWPA) is one of the most diverse and vibrant multi-genre MFA writing programs in the country. Our MFA student and alumni poets and prose writers have published full-length collections, memoirs and novels, chapbooks, reviews, essays and articles with first-rate houses and journals. Our playwrights and screenwriters have had plays staged locally and around the country, have optioned, sold and been hired to write scripts, and received some of the most prestigious awards in their fields. Due to the multi-genre nature of our program, our students often succeed in more than one field: fiction writers have not only published fiction, but seen their plays produced or screenplays optioned; screenwriters have published poems or stories; playwrights have placed creative non-fiction pieces. As the media in which we work and the old genre boundaries increasingly intersect, overlap and are redefined, our students are uniquely prepared to take advantage of every opportunity. Our program is truly multi-genre, and about excellent writing in whatever form it takes.To learn more about our program, our faculty and our students' achievements, please explore the following resources:?
