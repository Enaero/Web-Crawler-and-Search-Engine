Each year, the Gluck Fellows Program of the Arts provides fellowships to exceptional UC Riverside undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and visiting guest artists to conduct arts-related presentations, performances, and workshops in Riverside County schools, residential facilities for elderly care and community centers. Participating departments include Art, Creative Writing, Dance, History of Art, Music, and Theatre, as well as the Sweeney Art Gallery and the UCR/California Museum of Photography.Since its inception at UC Riverside in 1996, the Gluck Fellows Program of the Arts continues to follow its mission and goals of integrating the arts within the broader community. UC Riverside remains committed to the Program's target constituents, and continues to avail itself of the excellent faculty and student resources in the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.Gluck Fellows and Sites Orientation Fall 2013Attend Orientation Thursday OR SaturdayOrientation is split into 3 partsÅc Fellows only info - Sites and Fellows Together - Sites only infoThursday, September 26 1-3: Gluck Fellows old and new 3-3:45: Refreshments and Networking for Fellows and Site Representatives 3:45-4:45: Site Coordinators, Teachers, administrators and other OLD, NEW and INTERESTED community site staffORSaturday, September 28 10:00-11:30: Gluck Fellows old and new 11:30-12:00: Refreshments and Networking for Fellows and Sites Reps 12:00-1:00 Site Coordinators, Teachers, administrators and other OLD, NEW and INTERESTED community site staffCHASS Humanities 1500 University of California, Riverside, 92521Park in Lot 6 - $2.00 per hour on Wednesday, $1.00 per hour on Saturday Day permit $8.00, pay cash at the Kiosk on Campus Drive off University Yellow pedestrian signs with lead you to Humanities 1500RSVP by 9/18 or for more info: Christine Leapman ? 951 827 5739 Shane Shukis ? 951 827 3518 Gluckprogram.ucr@gmail.com???
