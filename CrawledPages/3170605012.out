Search for:Biological Control Specialist and Principal Investigator?Dr. Hoddle has headed the research in this laboratory since 1997 and is primarily involved in the identification of pest problems wf biological control could be a successful approach. The location, release and evaluation of natural enemy impacts on population growth features strongly in his research. The evaluation of biological control agents are conducted primarily in the field and, when necessary, aspects of both pest and natural enemy biology and behavior are studied in the laboratory.Biological Control Specialist and Research ScholarDr. Irvin joined the Hoddle laboratory in 2001 as a postdoctoral scholar. She has a heavy focus on researching the glassy-winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar), and its mymarid wasp biological control agents Gonatocerus ashmeadi, G. fasciatus, G. triguttatus and G. tuberculifemur.?Dr. Irvin has since been promoted to Assistant Specialist and in 2007 was awarded a Western Region Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (Western SARE) grant to investigate the use of nectar cover crops for sustainable pest control in California vineyards.?Assistant SpecialistChristina has collaborated with the Hoddle laboratory since 2004. Christina has dedicated her research efforts towards biological control and invasive species with an emphasis on crop pests. She has been involved in a variety of international projects sponsored by various granting agencies, private institutions, and commodity boards. An example of these finished and on-going projects include: hunting for bean thrips in Australia (Funded: Citrus Research Board-CRB), identification and production of pheromone for avocado seed moth (Stenoma catenifer) in Guatemala and Peru (Funded: CA Avocado Commission), searching for Asian citrus psyllid parasitoids in Pakistan (Funded: CDFA/CRB), monitoring?Rodolia cardinalis?populations on the Galapagos Islands and assessing the impact of this biocontrol agent on the cottony cushion scale,?Icerya purchasi?(Funded: Various Donors), red palm weevil (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus?andR. vulneratus) flight activity in Saudi Arabia (Funded: King Faisal University) and genetic analyses throughout southeast Asia (Funded: CDFA).?Associate Project ScientistDr. Rugman-Jones's research at UCR focuses on the problem posed by invasive insect pests to U.S. agriculture. Specifically, he is involved in the molecular identification and characterization of exotic insect pests and their natural enemies.Based in the Stouthamer lab at UCR, Dr. Rugman-Jones exploits variations in the DNA sequences of individuals to: resolve taxonomic and diagnostic issues; investigate population structure; and, identify the area of origin, and routes of entry, of exotic pests. The accurate identification of pests and natural enemies is fundamental to encouraging fair trade, selecting appropriate mitigation measures, and developing successful biological control programs.Ph.D. CandidateRicky joined the Hoddle laboratory in 2008 as a graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. in Entomology. His academic interests revolve around acarology, agroecology and integrated management of economically important pests in agriculture. This committed appreciation of acarology began with several undergraduate internships working in California vineyards.Ph.D. CandidateVanessa is a Ph.D. graduate student in the Entomology Department who joined the Hoddle Lab in September 2009. She is currently working on developing a classical biological control program for the invasive goldspotted oak borer (Agrilus auroguttatus). She has also previously done work researching the hitchhiking behavior and load selection of leaf-cutter ants (Atta cephalotes) in Monteverde, Costa Rica as an undergraduate in UCR's Education Abroad Program.Graduate Student ResearcherAllison entered the PhD program in Entomology in 2013, but her ties to the Hoddle lab stretch back much farther. While an undergraduate, she worked in Dr. Paul de Ley's lab (UCR Department of Nematology) researching marine and freshwater nematode ecology. After receiving her bachelor's degree in 2008, she left the De Ley lab and was hired by the Hoddle lab to assist on glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS) research being conducted in organic vineyards. After the GWSS project came to an end, Allison was transferred to a new project focusing on the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP),Diaphorena citri. She has been working with ACP and its associated natural enemies from Pakistan (Tamarixia radiata?(Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) and?Diaphorencyrtus aligarhensis?(Hymneoptera: Encyrtidae)) for the past 3 years, and is continuing this research as she pursues her PhD.Graduate Student ResearcherKelsey completed a project that examined the effect of Argentine ant density in citrus trees on successful parasitism of?D. citri?by?T. radiata. She also looked at the impact of a drop in Argentine ant density on host switching from tending ACP to tending more ÅgattractiveÅh citrus honeydew producers such as brown scale and mealybug. Her current research focuses on host competition between two?D. citri?parasitoids, the aforementioned?T. radiata?and?Diaporencyrtus aligarhensis. She hopes to determine if this interaction is a contributing factor to the lack of establishment of?D. aligarhensis?in Florida.?
