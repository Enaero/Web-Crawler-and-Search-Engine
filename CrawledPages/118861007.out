The Law and Society major offers undergraduates an interdisciplinary liberal arts approach to the study of legal and law-like relationships and institutions. The program combines the perspectives of various disciplines in the Humanities and Social Sciences. The multidisciplinary approach serves several purposes: it introduces students to a wider range of views about law than is generally possible within a single department, provides a coherent and rigorous program of courses organized around the theme of law and law-like relationships, and allows students to develop critical thinking about law and social institutions.Law and Society Program Department of Philosophy 1604 HMNSS Building University of California, Riverside Riverside, CA 92521-0201 Phone: (951) 827-5208 Fax: (951) 827-5298
