Search for:This rate of invasion results, on average, in six new species establishing in California each year. Economic loses to California from invasive species are estimated at $3 billion per year. The unique climate and geography of California provides diverse ecosytems which are perfect for the establishment of a diverse variety of new pests. CISR's researchers lead the way to determine how pests enter California, where invading populations came from and why these pests are successful in establishing California as their home.

Huanglongbing (HLB) Found in Los Angeles County In April 2012 the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) removed a pumelo tree with a lemon graft from Hacienda Heights in Los Angeles County after the tree and an Asian citrus psyllid found on the tree both tested positive for a lethal citrus disease, Huanglongbing (pronounced Wong-Long-Bing [HLB]). HLB is caused by a bacterium, and HLB-causing bacteria kill citrus by affecting the food transportation systems of infected trees. There is no known cure for the disease, and the HLB-bacterium does not pose a threat to humans, pets, or other plants.?Continue reading on CISR blogThe Red Palm Weevil is widely considered the most devastating insect to attack palms has been found in Laguna Beach, Orange County California. The weevil was originally found by a landscape specialist in late August 2010 infesting a Canary Islands palm in a residential area. Subsequent investigation by plant health regulatory officials confirmed the presence of weevils at the original detection site.Read more about the Red Palm WeevilThe Polyphagous Shot Hole Borer carries a symbiotic fungus.

This is a puzzling question for invasion biologists and regulators developing plans to manage invasive species. Dr. Norman Ellstrand , a Professor of Genetics in the Department of Botany and Plant Sciences at UC Riverside has studied this issue. In a new contribution to the CISR website, Norm provides two different ideas for us to think about: (1) some species are Ågborn badÅh and they have a natural ability to invade and become pests quickly, while (2) other introduced species that were initially well behaved in their new home for a very long time, perhaps a 100 years or more, under go slow genetic changes as they adapt to their new environment and they evolve to become invasive! You can read about more of these really interesting ideasInvasive species, alien species, exotic pests, bio-pollution, non-indigenous species, or invasive alien species, are common names that categorize non-native animals, microbes, diseases, or plants that are pests. These pests are not native in areas in which they cause problems and they are considered "invasive" because they invade new areas and the resulting invasion causes economic or environmental problems.
