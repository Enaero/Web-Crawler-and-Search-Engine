The Ohio State UniversityThe CLLC brings together scholars and experts from across the university and from around the world to increase our understanding of diverse cultures, expand our competence in foreign languages, and investigate the impact and creative potential contained in established and emerging media technologies. Globalization, democratization, and rapidly changing technology continually transform our increasingly interconnected world, posing new challenges and opportunities; in response, the CLLC offers graduate and undergraduate students the intellectual, linguistic, and cultural tools they need to succeed personally and professionally in our complex global economy.We hold the collective belief that the knowledge of one or more languages and the literatures and cultures they represent are essential components of a 21st-century education.Contact Us 100 Hagerty Hall 1775 College Road Columbus OH, 43210-1298E-Mail: cllc@osu.eduPhone: 614-292-4361Privacy Policy Questions, Feedback, Accessibility
