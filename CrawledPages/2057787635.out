??The Ohio State University requires all graduate applicants to apply online. No paper or downloadable applications are available. Please make your selection from the list below.Do not use the online application if you have previously enrolled as a degree-seeking student in the Graduate School at Ohio State. Instead, use this form from the Graduate School to: 1) change your degree being sought, e.g. Master's to Ph.D., within your graduate program; 2) change your graduate program of study; or 3) return to graduate studies in order to complete another graduate degree. The Graduate School should be contacted for information about eligibility and procedures at gs-regsrv@osu.edu.?
