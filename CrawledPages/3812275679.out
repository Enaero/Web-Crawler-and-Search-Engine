Search for:The Center for Plant Cell Biology addresses significant questions in plant biology on a molecular level to meet such global challenges as improved nutrition, increased crop yield, resistance to pests, sustainable biofuels, and environmental conservation. To accomplish this, the Center engages its world-class researchers, the scientific community, and industry in interdisciplinary research, employing the latest advances in computation biology, engineering, chemical genomics, proteomics, microscopy and bioinformatics.CEPCEB's annual symposium included an invited Noel T. Keen Lecturer, a variety of innovative speakers, an Awards Ceremony, catered lunch and breaks, and a Holiday Party ALL in one day!? The event-filled day started on Wednesday, December 18, 2013 at 9:00am and continued until after 6:00pm.?Our 11th annual Noel T. Keen Lecturer was Dr. Elliott Meyerowitz (http://www.bbe.caltech.edu/content/elliot-meyerowitz), an HHMI-GBMF Investigator and the George W. Beadle Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology. The day also included great food catered by PHOOD on Main, a reception catered by our fabulous in-house chef Mien van de Ven, as well as awards recognizing the research accomplishments of a few stellar students and postdocs.Twenty fellow graduate students, postdocs and faculty gave innovative rapid-fire "Tech Talks" (5 min.) and research presentations (15-20 min.) as part of this year's "Sensing" Symposium.?The program for the event is attached here.?CEPCEB celebrated its 10th anniversary with a full-day symposium on Friday, December 14, 2012 in the Genomics Auditorium. The program featured five external speakers, including our Noel T. Keen Lecturer James Carrington from the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, and three CEPCEB speakers.?

Plants are the basis of all life on Earth, whether as components of natural ecosystems or as domesticated crops used for food, feed and materials. After centuries of study, we are beginning to understand the complex signals and biochemical networks that allow plants to rapidly and exquisitely adapt to diverse environments as vital components of the earth's biosphere. The Center for Plant Cell Biology (CEPCEB) focuses on a diverse group of plants and fungi that provide the foundation for all life on earth. Capitalizing on the scientific momentum created by the genome sequencing of two important plants - Arabidopsis and rice - CEPCEB seeks to develop a comprehensive understanding of how plants function as whole organisms. The goal of this scientific challenge, involving an interdisciplinary effort by engineers, plant biologists, plant pathologists, chemists, physicists and computer scientists, is to apply the knowledge of how plants respond to their dynamic environment toward manipulation of crop plants safely and efficiently for better and more sustainable production.We are inspired to transfer our excitement of plant cell biology to a new generation of scientists who will extend research at our university around the world.
