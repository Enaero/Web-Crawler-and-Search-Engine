Search for:The mission of the Institute for Integrative Genome Biology is to:1 Systems based: the melding of computational approaches and technological innovations with molecular and cellular biology(February 4, 2014)Second-hand smoke and third-hand smoke are just as deadly as first-hand smoke, says IIGB cell biologist Manuela Martins-Green who, along with colleagues, conducted the first animal study of the effects of third-hand smoke.(February 4, 2014)Irma Ortiz, whose parents immigrated to the US from Mexico, is the first in her family to graduate from college. Today, Irma is a Ph.D. graduate student in IIGB geneticist Linda Walling's lab, where she and her lab-mates identify and deploy gene-based strategies for insect resistance in plants.(February 2, 2014)IIGB researchers led by assistant professor of entomology Anupama Dahanukar have performed a study that describes just how the fly's taste receptors detect sweet compounds, potentially offering tools to control insect feeding.(February 2, 2014)IIGB biologist Theodore Garland in collaboration with researchers from Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne and George Washington University published a study showing that island lizards are indeed "tame" as compared with their mainland relatives.(December 20, 2013)IIGB researchers are members of an international team -- the Amborella Genome Sequencing Project -- that has sequenced the genome of the Amborella plant. The genome sequence sheds new light on the origin of flowering plants, including all major food crop species.Living the Promise: See how faculty from the Center for Plant Cell Biology and the Center for Disease Vector Research are conducting breakthrough research in the areas of Sustainability and Health.
