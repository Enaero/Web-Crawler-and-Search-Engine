VISUALRESOURCESCOLLECTIONWelcome to the Visual Resources Collection (VRC) website. We are administered by the History of Art Department with support from CHASS. We are a unique campus resource currently maintaining: an analog slide collection (155,000); an archived digital image collection (30,000+), in addition to a growing online Digital Image Collection. Areas covered include Western architecture, sculpture, painting, photography, and illuminated manuscripts, as well as Latin American art and archaeology and Asian art concentrating on East Asian painting. Special slide collections for the Dance and Theatre department are also housed in the VRC.
