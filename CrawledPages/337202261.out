On October 8th, 2013 CE-CERT hosted the 2nd annual Science and Technology Education Partnership (STEP) Conference for high schools throughout the Riverside County District.The ninth search symposium between Shanghai Jiao Tong University and University of California, Riverside took place on October 30th, 2013 at CE-CERT. The nearly decade long collaboration between the universities have generously supported by William Johnson of Johnson Machinery Company of Riverside.CE-CERT's Dr. Chan Park, Associate Research Engineer in The Advanced Thermochemical Research Laboratory, will receive $94, 407 to develop a fuel sensing technology for natural gas vehiclesJill Luo and Apple Jin - Recipients of 2013 Women in Transportation ScholarshipThe South Coast Air Quality Management District, with co-funding from the California Energy Commission and Southern California Gas Company, has awarded $3,500,000 from the Clean Fuels Fund to Cummins Inc.Manufacturers reported the hybrid dozers and excavators reduced fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and cut smog-forming oxides of nitrogen emissions (NOx) by 30 percent. But, UC Riverside researchers found fuel savings of between 7 percent and 28 percent and NOx emission increases of up to 21 percent when compared to conventional diesel equipment.Best Poster award for: Evaluation of Selective Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry for Controlled Laboratory Studies.

Center for Environmental Research & Technology (CE-CERT)UCR's Southern California Research Initiative for Solar Energy (SC-RISE) is a partnership of the Bourns College of Engineering, industry affiliates government agencies, public and private utilities, trade organizations and other academic institutions. The center is developing materials for solar energy, solar energy systems, new photovoltaic devices and solar-thermal technologies. Also, the center will serve as an "honest broker" to provide reliable and unbiased information and advice on getting energy from the sun.View ProfileAssistant Professor of Chemical & Environmental EngineeringWorking in the worldÅfs largest indoor air quality chamber, Akua Asa-Awuku looks at particle formation in the atmosphere and how it interacts with water, affecting cloud formation and global climate change.View Profile?In 1992, the Bourns College of Engineering established the Center for Environmental Research & Technology (CE-CERT) as a model for partnerships among industry, government, and academia. CE-CERT's goals were to become a recognized leader in environmental education, a collaborator with industry and government to improve the technical basis for regulations and policy, a creative source of new technology, and a contributor to a better understanding of the environment.
