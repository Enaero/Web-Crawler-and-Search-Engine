This is great awesome and a privilege to be able to use and be part of I do hope these young people take full advantage of these facilities and that it motivates them toward excellence. Now all USC needs is a state of the art wrestling facility and a ace D 1 coach to get this fledgling club in top gear and help make the best h.s. wrestling state in the country the best collegiate wrestling state. USC can attract the best in the state if not the nation with the right coaching staff and facility. Fight on.GREAT! I walked by today and peaked through the doors. Looks Super! Can't wait to see from the inside. Fight On!great, how about some facilities for the 39,200 non-ncaa student athletes.
