Search for:The mission of the Center for Disease Vector Research is to develop and implement technologies that will alleviate the medical and economic burden exacted by insect-borne disease. The Center achieves this through cross-disciplinary research by combining expertise in insect pest control with expertise in molecular biology, nanotechnology, gene silencing and the genomics-based sciences. Our goal is to provide practical solutions to insect-borne disease control within therapeutic and economic time frames.During this century, humans will face new and unpredictable challenges due to the rise of novel vector-borne diseases, and the reemergence of preexisting ones. Rapid human population growth, climate change, and increased global travel and international trade create novel interactions with native reservoirs of potential pathogens, with consequences for the health of humans and domestic and wild animals, as well as crops and native plants. California, due to its international border, and the role that San Francisco and Los Angeles play as major ports of entry from Pacific Rim and South American countries, is particularly susceptible to the introduction of resurgent and novel diseases. Consequently, the Center for Disease-Vector Research seeks to address these pressing problems. Researchers at the Center will study vector-pathogen systems at the molecular, genetic and ecological levels and foster communication and idea cross-pollination between participating units, initiating collaborative research.The Center for Disease Vector Research aims to become a world leader in adopting a comprehensive approach to the problem of vector-transmitted pathogens at both basic and applied research levels.1. vector: a carrier that transfers an infective agent from one host to anotherTransgenic Aedes aegypti (yellow fever mosquito) expressing GFP in their eyes and dsRed in their testes Image: R.C.
