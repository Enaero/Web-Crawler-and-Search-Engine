Some of the topics covered include neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and neurochemistry in human and other animals; neural mechanisms underlying sensory system function and perception; neural organization of behavior; development of the nervous system; and neural mechanisms of learning and memory.Both a B.A. and a B.S. degree are offered by each college.
