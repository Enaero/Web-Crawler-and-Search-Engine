Our Department is the administrative home to 17 faculty members, approximately 60 graduate students (both Ph.D. and M.S. programs), 800 undergraduate Biochemistry majors, 11 postdoctoral fellows, and 25 support staff. Our major mission is to engage in basic biochemical and molecular biological research and instruction. The faculty of the Department is responsible for presentation of the undergraduate major in Biochemistry, which has three emphases: Biology, Chemistry, and Medical Sciences. ? The faculty of the department, in collaboration with 28 Cooperating Faculty in five other departments, constitutes the Graduate Program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology which is responsible for presentation of the Ph.D. and M.S. programs. Areas of research specialization represented within the Biochemistry Department and the Graduate Program span contemporary biochemistry? and include the following areas of concentration: molecular biology, physical biochemistry, molecular endocrinology, plant biochemistry & molecular biology, signal transduction, macromolecular chrystolography, and biomedical research.Biochemistry is a diverse discipline, and a bachelor's degree in it allows entry into fields such as biotechnology, cell biology, and the health professions. The Department of Biochemistry offers a B.S. or B.A. degree and students can choose one of three emphases - Biology, Chemistry, and Medical Sciences -- to meet their academic and career goals.
