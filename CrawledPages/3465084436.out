I divide the students up into groups of 10 after I lecture for a certain period and this means I can divide the class down the middle and have five turn their chairs to face five in back of them for discussion of an article that requires them to figure out how a case study applies to the lecture I gave. It worked so well as there was no time lost moving chairs or tables and the work groups were very efficient. I also was able to show visual clips of case study material on two screens, which means that everyone in the class could see and hear the visual material. It has made such a difference in the quality and quantity of teaching that got done in an hour and 20 minutes. From the student evaluations, they too found it a much improved educational experience.
