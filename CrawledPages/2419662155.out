The Water SENSE IGERT is intended to produce scholars who will be able to work in leadership positions in government, private, and nonprofit organizations interested in improving community health and child development outcomes via improved water supply, utilization, and management. The training Water SENSE IGERT Fellows will receive will prepare them in all aspects of water and waterborne disease management, including designing, executing and evaluating water-based interventions in close consultation ? and with the active participation ? of the intended beneficiaries. We will be teaching and using new and established approaches to water utilization and management, waterborne pathogen control and vector biology, and simultaneously training students in the social and cultural challenges required for the sustainable use of clean water.Water will become an even more important factor in determining human well-being in the future, as the worldÅfs population increases from roughly 6.5 billion now to 9 billion by 2050. Also as the developing worldÅfs population urbanizes, the demand for water transport and processing worldwide will increase significantly. Meanwhile, the supply of water is unlikely to increase and may decline as a result of major shifts in the worldÅfs climate. Since water scarcity has a direct link to water contamination, the future outlook for water-related morbidity and mortality is bleak, especially in the absence of major public interventions. Water scarcity also portends worldwide political instability as more people and nations compete for this vital resource.The vision of UCRÅfs Water SENSE IGERT is to impart three sets of skills toward creating?water scholars?who are able to address this complex and pressing problem.This vision will be realized by integrating expertise on water drawn from a variety of disciplines, including microbiology, entomology, environmental engineering, economics, public policy, psychology, sociology, political science, education, and anthropology, to develop practical, cost-effective, and sustainable solutions to improve the quantity and quality of water available and peopleÅfs use of this water. This expertise will be utilized by having cohorts of IGERT students focus on the water issues in a particular geographic region of California.The Water SENSE IGERT Fellows will engage in applied research that can improve water quantity and quality, thereby reducing exposure to waterborne diseases, increasing the supply of potable water, and improving human well-being. This will be accomplished through the development of multidisciplinary teams who will integrate their disciplinary knowledge towards the solution of the complex and severe water problems.The Water SENSE IGERT is intended to produce scholars who will be able to work in leadership positions in government, private, and nonprofit organizations interested in improving community health and child development outcomes via improved water supply, utilization, and management.
