Search for:No Events.Welcome to the Interdepartmental Graduate Program in Neuroscience at the University of California, Riverside! It's a great time to be interested in our program because UCR is currently expanding, particularly in the sciences. Neuroscience is a multidisciplinary approach to understanding nervous systems at levels ranging from the molecular and cellular to the behavioral and cognitive. The program aims to provide high quality graduate training for students who come from a variety of undergraduate backgrounds but share an intense interest in nervous system research. Our goal is to prepare students for high impact careers in research and teaching, as well as in scientific administration.We look forward to meeting you!
