New religious movements have long been a part of human history. At what point are they no longer considered Ågnew,Åh and if they relocate or retool despite their age, do they become ÅgnewÅh again?International scholars will address these and other questions at a daylong conference, ÅgWhen New Religious Movements Get Old,Åh on Feb. 14 at the University of California, Riverside. Eileen Barker, author of ÅgThe Making of a Moonie: Brainwashing or Choice?Åh and professor emeritus at the London School of Economics, and will present the keynote address.The conference begins at 10 a.m. and continues until 6 p.m. in the Interdisciplinary Building.

ÅenewÅf religious movements, the LDS nears its second century of existence, while the JehovahÅfs Witnesses are 150 years old,Åh said Ivan Strenski, the Holstein Family and Community Professor of Religious Studies at UCR.The enormous variety of new religious movements makes it impossible to generalize much about them, he added. ÅgBut, we can ask ? and we will ? what happens when the so-called ÅenewÅf religious movements get on in years? How have the JehovahÅfs Witnesses changed in their century-and-a-half existence? How, as well, has a very ancient religious movement, Yoga, become ÅenewÅf again in being imported into the West? Or, how have NRMs, old in the West, likewise become ÅeyoungÅf again by being imported into the post-communist world, or by being retooled for a presence on the Internet?ÅhBarker will be joined by scholars from universities in Denmark, Lithuania and California. Her topic is ÅgNew and Not-So-New Religious Movements: Changes in Åethe Cult SceneÅf over the Past Forty YearsÅh and will explore features that might be expected in an NRM in its early years and changes that it is likely to undergo over time. She also will consider relevant changes in the wider society since the 1970s.Barker is professor emeritus of sociology with special reference to the study of religion at the London School of Economics. The author of more than 350 publications, her research focuses on new religions and the reactions they elicit.
