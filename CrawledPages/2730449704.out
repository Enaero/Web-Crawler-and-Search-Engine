We offer students enrichment through studying the literatures, languages, and cultures of an increasingly global society. We teach eleven world languages, film studies, theory, and linguistics. Comparative and transnational studies are emphasized and encouraged. Our Graduate Program is characterized by its balance of Asia alongside Europe and the Middle East, and offers tracks in Interliterary, Interdisciplinary, and Science Fiction Studies.
