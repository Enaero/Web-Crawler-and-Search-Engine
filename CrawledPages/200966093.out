The Liberal Studies major includes a core of lower-division courses designed to provide students with broad subject matter coverage to give them the foundation needed to pass the CSET and enable them to be well prepared to teach. The five upper-division tracks allow students to build upon their strengths and interests and at the same time provide them with a connection to the core Education courses.
