The Public Records Act does not require that the University answer questions, perform research, or create new records or reports. Public records maintained by the University of California, Riversideare available for public access according to the following procedures:Requests for inspection or copying of public records:Exemptions: UCR will provide access to all public records upon request, unless the law provides an exemption from mandatory disclosure. (See Gov. Code Åò 6254 et seq.)Examples of exempt records may include personnel records, investigative records, draft, confidential legal advice, records prepared in connection with litigation, and information that may be kept confidential under the state or federal laws.Copying Costs: Copies of records that are not exempt from disclosure are available upon pre-payment of the copying costs (25 cents per page).Inspection of Records: If a requester wishes to inspect the records instead of, or in advance of, requesting copies of the records to be made, such inspection of records will be allowed upon reasonable conditions determined by UCR. There is no public counter service for on-demand, same day public records inspections; nor does the law require such a public counter. Identification and collection of potentially responsive records are only some of the steps involved in responding to requests. The collected records must be reviewed to ensure that they are in fact responsive to the request and to assess whether they are subject to redaction to protect the privacy rights of others and consistent with applicable legal privileges and exemptions. Each of the steps in the process takes time. When records requests are available for release, we will contact you. If you prefer to inspect the records before paying for copies, we are happy to set up a mutually convenient time for such an inspection. The operational functions of UCR will not be suspended to permit inspection of records during periods in which such records are reasonably required by UCR personnel in the performance of their duties.Upon either the completion of the inspection or the oral request of UCR personnel, the person conducting the inspection shall relinquish physical possession of the records. Persons inspecting UCR records shall not destroy, mutilate, deface, alter, or remove any such records from UCR. UCR reserves the right to have UCR personnel present during the inspection of records in order to prevent the loss or destruction of records.Time Deadlines: UCR has 10 days to determine if it will disclose the requested records. If records cannot be provided within these deadlines, we will provide an estimated delivery date, and the records will be disclosed in a reasonable period of time. The law does not require production of records within 10 days. (Motorola v. Department of General Services (1997) 55 Cal.
