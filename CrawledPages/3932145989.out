Search for:The Entry-Level Writing Requirement (ELWR) is a University of California reading and writing proficiency requirement that all first-year students must satisfy. Please note that this requirement is not an admissions requirement.It must be satisfied either before beginning courses on a UC campus or during the first year of enrollment. If students have not passed the requirement upon entrance as full-time students, they must satisfy the requirement within three quarters of full-time enrollment.UC Riverside strongly urges students to fulfill the Entry-Level Writing Requirement (ELWR) before starting classes in the fall. By doing so, students can begin their first quarter enrolled in the required English Composition sequence (ENGL 001ABC), thus taking a step toward finishing their undergraduate degrees within four years.For more information please visit the ELWR homepage.
