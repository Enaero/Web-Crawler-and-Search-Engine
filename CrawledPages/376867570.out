Search for:This mentoring program is intended to be a useful way of helping new faculty members adjust to their new environment. Whether it is academe itself that is new, or simply the UCR campus, assistance from a well-respected mentor can be an invaluable supplement to the guidance and assistance that a Department Chair or Dean provides during the early years at a new university. Participation is voluntary, so the program's success will depend on the new faculty members, their mentors and their department chairs all taking an active role in the acclimation process.
