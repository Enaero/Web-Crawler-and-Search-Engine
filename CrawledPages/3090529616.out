The UCR School of Medicine residency training program in family medicine, in partnership with Desert Regional Medical Center, has received accreditation and will accept its first residents for the three-year training program in July 2015.The program ? designed and located in Palm Springs to help address the shortage of primary care physicians in the Coachella Valley ? was granted accreditation in late January by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), the national body responsible for post-M.D. training programs in the U.S.Family medicine is a primary care medical specialty in which physicians provide comprehensive medical care to patients of all ages and, increasingly, coordinate patientsÅf care by subspecialists. It is estimated that the area of the Coachella Valley served by Desert Regional Medical Center has a 50 percent shortage of family medicine physicians.ÅgFamily medicine will remain pivotal in addressing the healthcare needs of both our regionGemma Kim, MDand our nation,Åh said Dr. Gemma Kim, program director of the medical schoolÅfs family medicine residency training program in Palm Springs. ÅgWe hope to expand access and strengthen primary care in the Coachella Valley while providing personalized care of the highest quality that is patient-, family- and community-centered.ÅhResidents will train primarily at Desert Regional Medical Center and the UCR Health Family Medicine Center adjacent to the medical center. The three-year program will enroll eight residents each year, meaning there will be a total of 24 residents when the family medicine program is fully developed. Eight family physicians will graduate from the residency program each year starting in 2018.ÅgThe approval of the UCR residency program at Desert Regional Medical Center is such an exciting event for our hospital, as we continue to grow as an academic medical center,Åh said Carolyn Caldwell, president and chief executive officer of Desert Regional Medical Center. ÅgThe physician faculty of UCR Health have already provided a wonderful resource to patients through the primary care offices they have opened on our campus. They are already making a difference in helping to solve the primary care physician shortage in our Valley.Åh?Desert Regional Medical CenterÅgDesert Regional looks forward to welcoming our first class of UCR residents in family medicine,Åh Caldwell said. ÅgWe know that academic medicine brings with it a whole range of clinical insights and expertise. It will be a wonderful experience for our current physicians, our nurses, our staff and ? most of all ? our patients.ÅhStart-up of the program has been supported by the Desert Healthcare District, which in 2012 awarded a $5 million, five-year grant to the UCR School of Medicine to assist in establishing primary care services in the region, launch residency training and expand programs for Coachella Valley students interested in pursuing medicine as a career.ÅgThe goal of the UCR medical school with this residency program, expanding access to the highest quality patient-centered medical care, aligns perfectly with a key objective of the Desert Healthcare District to address the healthcare workforce shortage,Åh said Kathy Greco, executive director of the healthcare district. ÅgWe are pleased to be a partner with the UCR School of Medicine.ÅhResidency programs provide the post-M.D. training required for physicians to become fully independent and board certified in their specialties. Family medicine training programs are three years long and, during that time, residents provide patient care under the supervision of attending physicians who are faculty of the residency program.Expanding residency training programs is a key strategy of the UCR School of Medicine to address the severe physician shortage in Inland Southern California, according to Dr. G. Richard Olds, vice chancellor for health affairs at UCR and dean of the School of Medicine. That is because physicians tend to practice in the geographic area where they complete their residency training.ÅgWe are pleased to be launching this new residency training program in the Coachella Valley, where there is a demonstrated serious shortage of primary care doctors,Åh Olds said. ÅgWe plan to add residency training programs in other medical specialties in the years to come.Åh?The Desert Healthcare District is supporting the start-up of a new family medicine residency training program to accept its first residents in July 2015.
