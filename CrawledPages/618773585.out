In the Fall of 2009, Prof. David Pion-Berlin (Political Science) introduced the students to the meaning, evolution, and theories of Human Rights. Prof. Perry Link (Comparative Literature) took over for Winter 2010 and used specific case studies to discuss Human Rights in contemporary China. Using the fundamentals of the stage such as storytelling, acting design and directing, the students created their own performance pieces during Spring 2010 with the help of Prof. Rickerby Hinds (Theater). The video, "Awake Humans, Arise" presents a short take of the Human Rights Capstone project.Random Quote: "I do not make it my business to tell the world what it should do-enough others do that-but what I do in it" ?Montaigne 142?
