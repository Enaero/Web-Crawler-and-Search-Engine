Linguistics is the science of language. Linguistic majors study the psychological and physical mechanisms of human speech, the similarities and differences among languages, the origin of languages and how they change, and how language is acquired. Linguistics also interacts well with many other fields such as biology's articulatory phonetics, physics' acoustic phonetics, anthropology's language and culture, plus sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, logic, the philosophy of language, and the study of particular languages. This presents students with broad opportunities to customize studies to meet individual academic and career goals, including the possibility of a double major that provides strong preparation in two fields at the same time. Possible double majors include combining Linguistics with Anthropology, Computer Science, English, Languages, Liberal Studies, Psychology, Philosophy or Sociology.
