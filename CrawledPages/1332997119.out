Search for:University Honors is designed for students who have shown through their own high achievement that they value intellectual challenges and want to be a part of an innovative, diverse, and demanding learning community. Students benefit from close interaction with Honors Faculty in small class settings, and with Professional Staff who provide developmental advising to help them optimize their educational experience at UCR. High impact, experiential learning opportunities available to Honors students include; undergraduate research, scholarly and creative work, internships, service learning, and faculty-led co-curricular activities. In addition Honors students are supported by a strong peer leader support system, faculty mentorship, Honors scholarship opportunities, and preparation for prestigious scholarships and awards.
