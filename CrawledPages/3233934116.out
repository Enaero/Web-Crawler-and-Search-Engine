This is for our BIG (Bioengineering Interdeparmental Graduate) Program.Find out what students are saying about UCR's Bioengineering Program:"The excitement of the diverse and beautiful UCR campus made me realize that it would foster my foundation with the best of engineering principles and cutting-edge technologies for my future aspirations..."The Bioengineering Interdepartmental Graduate (BIG) program is exceptional with an additional 30 faculty across UCR, enhancing research opportunities for their students. A network of research centers, including the newly established Center for Bioengineering Research (CBR), provides extensive support for their research programs with core capabilities in genomics, bioimaging, bioinformatics, proteomics, nanotechnology, analytical chemistry and stem cell technology. And BIG is one of the few biomedical engineering programs where the graduate students can take?non-clinical medical school courses?alongside of the medical students.All of this culminates into a truly exceptional educational and research program to produce the best graduates for future advancements in Bioengineering, Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology.
