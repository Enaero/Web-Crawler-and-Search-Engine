UCR faculty research spans t??he whole spectrum of sociological inquiry, from micro-dynamics of human identity and emotions to larger processes involving social institutions, corporate organizations, and global social structures. Our current and emeritus faculty includes one of two UC sociologists to ever receive the distinction of University Professor, multiple Distinguished Professors, former presidents and vice presidents of the American and Pacific Sociological Associations (PSA, ASA), former editors of official ASA journals, ASA section chairs and council members, among other noteworthy titles. Our faculty is also incredibly productive. The most recent NRC data on publications, citations, grants and awards ranks UCR sociology second among UC sociology departments.??Training graduate students for successful careers as scholars and teachers is at the core of our mission. The graduate program at UCR grants doctoral degrees, and allows students to earn a MasterÅfs degree along the way. To provide our students with state of the art training in the field, the faculty recently approved an updated graduate curriculum. The program provides strong training in sociological theory and methods, as well as depth in any two of the departmentÅfs seven areas of specialization: Criminology and Socio-Legal Studies, Gender Studies, Organizations and Institutions, Political Economy and Global Social Change, Race and Class Inequality, Social Psychology, and Sociological Theory. We prioritize hands-on training in sociological research, and provide many opportunities for collaborative research between faculty and graduate students. Please see the links on this page for more information.We offer undergraduate training that covers a broad range of sociological inquiry, including ethnicity, race and class inequality, gender, social stratification, sociology of education, the city and urban problems, the environment, sociology of religion, crime and deviance and global social change. Course topics also include formal and large organizations, the family, political organizations, language diversity in the United States, evolutionary sociology and social psychology.
