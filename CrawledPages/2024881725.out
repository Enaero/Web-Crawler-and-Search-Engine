The mission of the UCR Stem Cell Center is to advance the stem cell field by fostering basic and translational research and engaging in education and outreach.Researchers at the Center have expertise in many different fields including developmental biology, cancer biology, endocrinology, aging, nanotechnology, neuroscience and bioengineering.We offer graduate courses in Stem Cell Biology (CMBS 207), the Bioethics of Stem Cell Biology (CMBD 208), and Advanced Topics in Stem Cell Biology (BCH 230). In addition, students are exposed to stem cell biology in undergraduate courses such as CBNS 108 (Introduction to Development) and CMDB 169 (Human Embryology).We offer workshops in Stem Cell Biology.We draw students from a number of different graduate programs in Engineering, Chemistry, Biomedical Sciences, and the Life Sciences.Diseases that could in the future be treated by stem cell biology include (but are not limited to) diabetes, ParkinsonÅfs disease, spinal cord injury, AlzheimerÅfs disease, aging, heart disease, stroke, burns, amputations, and osteoarthritis.Stem cell biology will form an important component in both the UCR Health Sciences Research Institute and future Medical School, which will work to facilitate translational research.Web link to UCR Health Sciences Research Initiative: http://www.hsri.ucr.edu/ Web link to Medical School: http://www.medschool.ucr.edu/The UCR Stem Cell Center is making major contributions to stem cell biology by attacking basic biological problems at an interdisciplinary level, enabling translation to the clinical level, and by using stem cells to monitor the effects of the environment on human health.The Center has faculty working with various types of stem cells including human embryonic, mouse embryonic, hematopoietic, and human umbilical cord stem cells.Stem cells are valuable tools that have the potential not only to treat numerous diseases, but also to study development and evaluate the toxicity of chemicals and drugs.
