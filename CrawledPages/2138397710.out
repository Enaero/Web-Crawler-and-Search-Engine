Together, they seek to define neuronal-glial interactions required for optimal brain and spinal cord function as well as for prevention and therapeutic intervention of neurodevelopmental, neurologic and neurodegenerative diseases.Why focus on Glial-Neuronal Interactions in CNS health and disease?Brain and spinal cord function depends not only on neurons, but on glia. Glia are the non-neuronal elements of the central nervous system (CNS) and comprise approximately 90 percent of the cells within the CNS.The advent of high resolution in vivo imaging has revealed that glia are constantly active in the healthy CNS. Genetic, molecular and epidemiologic studies have also revealed the prominent and often causative roles these cells can play in the pathogenesis of many common neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders including:Glial interactions with neurons also play critical roles in loss of function caused by spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury. CGNI investigators are revealing routes and consequences of glial-neuronal interactions aimed at identifying risk factors as well as therapies for CNS disease and dysfunction.
