Committed to disseminating the results of our programs to the Riverside community and beyond, we offer public activities that attempt to challenge, stimulate and enlighten broad participation in the questions the humanities ask: Who are we? What gives our lives meaning? How ought we act? What should we value? What can the arts, cultures, religions, activities, practices and histories of the world teach us? The CenterÅfs fellowships, research workshops, and public richly reflect this important examination.We invite you to explore this website to discover more about the humanities at CIS. Moreover, we invite you to visit us in person and to attend our public lectures and events.In 2009, a 5-year grant from the UC Office of Research and Graduate Studies funded the new UC Humanities Network, incorporating and expanding the original UC Humanities Initiative launched by UC President David Gardner in 1986.
