It is only through this type of correct action that one can hope to build a better community.?Ni m?s, ni menos.? Tom?s Rivera ÅgThe Role of the Chicano Academic and the Non-Academic Chicano CommunityÅh??A NOTE FROM THE DIRECTORFor over two decades, the Tom?s Rivera Conference has annually held events focused on core issues facing Chicanos/Latinos, particularly those that were central to RiveraÅfs career and his concerns about the future. This year marks the 26th conference and is focused on the theme of ÅgCivic Morality,Åh a term he used to convey his belief that we have a responsibility to actively serve the community as ambassadors of knowledge. Because of RiveraÅfs own evolution, growing up a child migrant farmworker and becoming Chancellor of the University of California, Riverside (1979-1984), as well as a foundational poet (The Searchers) and novelist (And the Earth Did Not Devour Him), he understood in a very personal way how education has the power to transform individuals and society. He saw cultivating excellence and sharing it through our work as key things we can do to transform society. In graduation speeches, Rivera often advised students, ÅgIt is your responsibility to build and maintain a community wherever you are. Let that be your mark as an educated person.ÅhThis yearÅfs conference brings together distinguished creative artists, scholars and activists who exemplify the practice of civic morality. The day takes place on Friday, February 21, with registration and check in at 10:30 am; as you approach the conference location at the Highlander Union Building, look for an outside public space performance of ÅgThe Xican@ Pop-Up Book MovementÅh by johnavalos Rios. The conference opens with a live musical presentation by Martha Gonzalez and Quetzal Flores of the Grammy awarded Quetzal, and then a buffet lunch. The Keynote Plenary will run from 12:30 pm ? 1:15 pm with Master Class workshop leaders presenting about their work followed by break out sessions of individual workshops exploring such topics as: music and social justice; dance and arts activism; hip-hop theatre of social change; murals and mutual mentoring; non-profit organizations and programming for at-risk youth; Latinas and reproductive justice; immigrant rights and LBGTIQ rights; shaping the arts and entertainment industry for the 21st century. Registration for the conference is free with all of the dayÅfs events open to the public. (Registration is to secure seats at lunch, the plenary, and/or participation in the workshops.)There are also two special conference tie-in events: Friday evening February 21, the UCR Department of Theatre will present a performance of the Tony award winning In the Heights, a musical by Quiara Alegr?a Hudes and Lin-Manual Miranda, followed by an audience talk-back with Dr. Brian Eugenio Herrera from Princeton University. (The show runs for 7 performances, February 20 ? March 1.)
