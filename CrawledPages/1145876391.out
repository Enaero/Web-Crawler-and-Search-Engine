Course proposals are how academic departments suggest creating a new course, changing an existing course, or bringing an old course back to life.When faculty initiate a proposal, a designated preparer enters it into a program called the Course Request and Maintenance System, or CRAMS.The proposal is then routed through an approval process in which the shared system allows for multiple approvers to provide feedback. Ultimate approval is granted by the Committee on Courses.See a detailed overview of how course proposals work.Search for a CourseLast day for course due in CRAMS for Winter 2014 ?
