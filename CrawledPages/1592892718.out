The Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences program serves the interdisciplinary needs of the College by providing coursework and a major program that do not correspond to any one of the traditional academic subjects. We offer a home for cross-disciplinary cooperation among faculty who wish to teach subjects that span our college and the wider campus. We offer liberal arts courses that provide both beginning and more advanced UCR students with insights into the broad spectrum of knowledge and the interconnections among the content and methods of various academic disciplines. We provide an individual major through which students with unusual interests may create their own specialized program of study under the supervision of a UCR faculty member.?Location: Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences Interdisciplinary Program 3111 CHASS Interdisciplinary Building South University of California, Riverside Riverside, CA 92521 Phone (951) 827-2742 Fax (951) 827-2237
