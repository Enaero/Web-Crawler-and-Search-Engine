The Botanic Gardens of the University of California, Riverside will greatly benefit from a bequest of $1.3 million from Victor Goodman, who helped found the gardens, and his wife, Marjorie ? both longtime supporters of the gardens.The only museum on main campus open on weekends, the Botanic Gardens receive around 40,000 visitors a year.? Nestled in the foothills of the Box Springs Mountains on the east side of the UC Riverside campus, the gardens constitute a natural preserve, displaying plants, animals, birds and insects (especially butterflies) that thrive in inland Southern California.ÅgWe are thrilled and grateful that the Botanic Gardens were remembered with such a significant gift,Åh said Jodie Holt, the divisional dean of agriculture and natural resources in UC RiversideÅfs College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences. ÅgWith it we will be able to bring some key projects to completion and invest in additional maintenance of important plant collections. Additionally, this generous gift will enable us to make significant progress towards realizing the long range plan and financial security of the UCR Botanic Gardens.ÅhVictor Goodman was the first botanist hired by UCRÅfs Division of Life Sciences ? later to become the Department of Biology ? in 1954, and was, therefore, a founding faculty member of the College of Letters and Science. ?He joined the Department of Botany and Plant Sciences in 1978, retiring the following year.?

She died in January 2012.ÅgThe idea for what eventually became the UCR Botanic Gardens was Victor GoodmanÅfs,Åh said J. Giles Waines, the director of the gardens. ÅgHe saw the need for them and proposed that UCR establish the gardens. He and Marjorie lived close to campus and cherished this museum. It comes as no surprise to me that they left their estate to the gardens.ÅhVictor Goodman was instrumental in having 40 acres on the east side of campus set aside as the ÅgLife Sciences Research Area.Åh? Subsequently, this area was renamed the UCR Botanic Gardens. A former army officer, Goodman was a skilled administrator and served as an advisor to students. He was an expert in lichens and amassed an extensive photographic documentation of lichens in the Riverside area. ?He taught a variety of courses in botany, including plant anatomy, plant morphology, plant physiology and field botany.A man strolls through the UCR Botanic Gardens.In 1954 he hired Frank Vasek, a new Ph.D. in plant taxonomy from UCLA, to share the teaching load, particularly in field botany. Vasek was appointed the first director of the Botanic Gardens, in 1962. Since Vasek, the gardens have been led by George Gillett (1967 to 1973), Louis Erickson (1973 to 1981), and Waines (1981 to present).Maintenance of the gardens costs about $100,000 annually. Plans are underway to place the major part of the funds received from the Goodman estate into the Victor and Marjorie Goodman Endowment for the Botanic Gardens, which will help maintain the much-loved gardens in perpetuity.The Friends of UCR Botanic Gardens Support Group, formed in 1980, has more than 1,000 paying members, and helps raise funds each year to support maintenance and development of the Botanic Gardens. The gardens also receive some funds from donors.Children at a recent workshop at the UCR Botanic Gardens.The Botanic Gardens offer a rich diversity of vegetation, creating a hospitable sanctuary for wildlife.
