We believe that our policies and programs for preventing and reducing crime, and our emergency notices, timely warnings and disclosure of crimes reported, promote a safer, more informed community. Please take time to read this information and, if you have questions, contact the resources identified below for assistance.The "Jeanne CLERY Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act of 1998," commonly referred to as the "CLERY Act," requires institutions of higher education receiving federal financial aid to report specified crime statistics on college campuses and to provide other safety and crime information to members of the campus community.The University provides crime information and statistics to the public in a variety of ways. In addition to the CLERY Act, the University provides to the California Department of Justice crime statistics that are classified pursuant to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program administered by the FBI. These statistics are reflected in the University of California Police Department Annual Report and Crime Statistics, the annual California Department of Justice Crime in California, and the annual FBI Crime in the United States publications.This report contains information regarding:Health effects of substance abuseLocal Reporting Municipal Police Departments:The University has designated certain administrators and staff as ÅgCampus Security AuthoritiesÅh in recognition that many students, faculty and staff may be hesitant about reporting crimes to UCR PD, and may be more inclined to report incidents to non-law enforcement administrators and staff instead.The law defines ÅgCampus Security AuthorityÅh as: ÅgAn official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, including, but not limited to, student housing, student discipline, and campus judicial proceedings.Åh An example would be a dean of students who oversees student housing, a student center, or student extra-curricular activities and has significant responsibility for student and campus activities. Similarly, a director of athletics, team coach, and faculty advisor to a student group also has significant responsibility for student and campus activities. A single teaching faculty member is unlikely to have significant responsibility for student and campus activities, except when serving as an advisor to a registered student group. Clerical staff, as well, is unlikely to have significant responsibility for student and campus activities. For more information about the Clery Act and the role of Campus Security Authorities go to http://police.ucr.edu/clery/clery.html and click ÅgClery Act TrainingÅh for a short power point presentation.Campus Security Authorities are charged with reporting to the appropriate law enforcement personnel, either UCR PD or local police, or to any official or office which should be informed of the crime or complaint due to the nature of the crime or complaint, those allegations of Clery Act crimes that the Campus Security Authority concludes are made in good faith.? A Campus Security Authority is not responsible for determining whether a crime took place as that is the function of law enforcement and its investigatory process.A Campus Security Authority is required to report all allegations to law enforcement personnel, even if the Campus Security Authority was told of a crime in the context of providing emotional support or health care support.? The allegations will be reported whether or not the victim chooses to file a report with law enforcement or press charges.? A Campus Security Authority may also provide a victim or witness with assistance in reporting a crime to UCR PD or local police, or to any official or office which should be informed of the crime or complaint.Pastoral counselors and mental health counselors at the University are not Campus Security Authorities, and are therefore exempt from disclosing or reporting allegations of crimes and incidents.? However, to be exempt from the Clery Act reporting requirements, the counselor must be acting in their professional role of pastoral or mental health counselors at the University.? For example, a Dean who has a PhD in Psychology is not acting in the counseling role, but rather as a Dean; and a PhD student in Psychology working in the counseling center as part of his/her education and training is acting in the counseling role.? Pastoral counselors and mental health counselors are trained in the procedures for reporting crimes and the procedures for reporting crimes confidentially.? The University encourages them to inform their clients of the procedures in accordance with their professional judgment, given the individual victim and circumstances before them.In addition, the Student Health Services employees, including the medical director, physicians and nurses are not Campus Security Authorities.The UC Riverside Police Department? operates 24 hours-per-day, 365 days a year. It is the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) for all 9-1-1 system calls originating from telephones located at UCR, meaning that responses to all 9-1-1 calls (Police/Fire/Medical emergencies) are coordinated through the UC Police Department. The department is an authorized terminal user of all local, regional, state and federal criminal justice information systems (e.g., wanted persons, DMV, stolen vehicles/property, criminal records, etc.). UC Riverside Police Department employs Police Officers and Community Service Officers (CSO's) to deliver public safety services to the campus community.Our goal is to provide timely and appropriate responses to community problems and needs. Police officers of the UC Riverside Police Department are armed, duly sworn peace officers of the State of California. Empowered by section 830.2(b) of the California Penal Code, UC Riverside Police Officers possess the same authority, and adhere to the same state-mandated standards, as municipal police officers. Therefore, under California law, UC Riverside Police Officers may enforce laws and make arrests anywhere in the state; however, we concentrate our efforts on the campus and its immediate surrounding area.UC Riverside Police Officers may work in uniform or plain-clothes. They provide a full range of police related services, including: primary emergency responses; preventative patrols; investigation of observed, reported, or suspected crimes; enforcement of all applicable laws; follow-up and specialized criminal investigations; crime prevention; community liaison and relations; V.I.P./dignitary protection; special event security; traffic activities (enforcement and accident investigations).Persons arrested by the UC Riverside Police Officers are processed in accordance with prevailing practices in Riverside County, which can include: citation and release; booking into the Riverside County Jail; filing of charges with, and prosecution through, the District Attorney's Office; and formal trial. Additionally, UCR affiliates (student, faculty, staff) may be subject to additional (administrative/Code of Conduct) sanctions.By mutual agreement with state and federal agencies, The University Police Department maintains an NLETS terminal (National Law Enforcement Telecommunications Network).? Through this system police personnel can access the National Crime Information Computer system as well as the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS).? These computer databases are used for accessing criminal history data, nationwide police records, driver/vehicle identification information, as well as other local, state and federal law enforcement information.Community Service Officers (CSO's) are student employees. They wear distinctive shirts and/or jackets, are not armed, and perform many specialized services for the community, including: contract security patrols (e.g., campus housing areas), campus building security checks/unlocks/lock-ups, and occasional campus escorts.Our department enjoys a positive and close working relationship with the City of Riverside Police Department, with whom we share proximity, mutual interests, and geographic jurisdiction. Both Police Departments share information regarding crimes in each jurisdiction. Additionally, both departments participate in the University Neighborhood Enhancement Team.The University Neighborhood Enhancement Team (UNET) is a cooperative effort between the UC Riverside Police Department? and the Riverside Police Department. Each agency has committed four officers and one sergeant to a seventeen square mile area, which surrounds the university. Officers are encouraged to identify community concerns and seek out novel approaches to solving those concerns.UNET team members work two shifts, day shift and swing shift. Officers from the UC Riverside are paired up with officers from the Riverside Police Department. This has proven crucial, as the officers can act as liaisons for the respective agency. UNET team members work primarily in full uniform and drive marked police cars.One of the most effective tools at UNET's disposal is the use of the bicycle in patrol activities. UNET regularly conducts bicycle crime abatement programs, which have resulted in numerous arrests for drug related crimes and has impacted the neighborhood with a significant decrease in overall crime activity. UNET has focused on everything from drugs and gangs, to burglaries and auto thefts during these programs.UNET has been working very closely with the University Neighborhood Association ( UNA ). UNA is a community action group, which is comprised of residents, university students and university staff who live in the immediate area. UNET team members attend UNA monthly meetings and bring community concerns back to the team. The team has proactively worked on the concerns of UNA and brought several issues to a close. Traffic problems and neighbor conflicts with college students renting homes in the area continue to be the association's main concerns.In response to these concerns, team members have developed programs to fight them head on. As a result, traffic enforcement days have resulted in numerous citations being issued, impacting many of the traffic problems presented by UNA . Team members continue to work with student groups who rent single-family residences in the area. These students often clash with residents who have lived in their neighborhoods for many years. Officers have resolved several problems through conflict resolution techniques and have acted as mediators between the students and residents. We have also used the regular party patrols and enforcement of the Riverside City Loud Party Ordinance effectively. This ordinance has decreased the number of repeat visits by law enforcement to loud party calls and helps to quickly stop the disturbances. Considerable time and effort has been spent helping the students understand how to be good neighbors.UNA has been instrumental in identifying problems in the university neighborhood, and UNET continues to work closely with this organization, as their goal is to better their neighborhood.Team members have been assigned to individual apartment complexes within the UNET boundaries and are working closely with those apartment's managers. Team members are assisting the managers through the Riverside Crime Free Multi Housing Program and have begun "Phase 3" inspections for the program. The apartment managers, as well as the UNET officers have been very receptive to the program and are continuing to make their complexes safe for their residents.Since the UNET team was developed in 1994, there has been a significant decrease in Part One crimes in UNET reporting districts. The UNET reporting districts continue to show a decrease in crime, and those reporting areas accounted for only 1.5% of all Part One crimes in the city. The significance of the decrease should be filtered, to some degree, with the regional and national trends of decreasing crime. Certainly, the team cannot claim sole responsibility for the decrease in crime. Rather, the UNET community, working hand in hand with the police, taking responsibility for their neighborhoods, and helping to develop crime control priorities should get most of the credit.There is no memorandum of understanding between the UC Riverside Police Department and the Riverside Police Department.Community members, students, faculty, staff and guests are encouraged to report all crimes and public safety related incidents to the UC Riverside Police Department in a timely manner.?All police/fire/medical emergencies should be reported immediately, utilizing the 9-1-1 system reporting procedure appropriate to the telephone instrument or by using the emergency call boxes located in or adjacent to parking lots.The purpose of the emergency call boxes is to provide a method for people to alert the UC Riverside Police Department, of any emergency or suspicious circumstances they may observe. To activate the box, open the box, press the button and tell the UC Riverside Police Department Dispatcher what you have seen. If in an emergency you are unable to speak, you can alert the Police simply by pressing the button. This will signal the dispatcher who will then send assistance.Non-Emergency/Routine BusinessNon-emergency business may be reported/handled by calling ext. 25222. When off campus, dial (951) 827-5222.Confidential Reporting of CrimesVictims or witnesses may report crimes on a voluntary, confidential basis for inclusion in the annual disclosure of crime statistics by mailing a written statement or by calling the UC Riverside Police Department. ?Also, the University encourages pastoral counselors and professional counselors, if and when they deem appropriate, to inform the persons they are counseling to report crimes on a voluntary, confidential basis for inclusion in the annual disclosure of crime statistics by mailing a written statement to the University of California Police Department, 3500 Canyon Crest Drive, Riverside, CA 92521, or by calling the University of California Police Department at (951) 827-5222. You may also leave an anonymous tip on our website: http://police.ucr.edu/anon.htmlCrimes should be reported to the UC Riverside Police Department to ensure inclusion in the annual crime statistics and to aid in providing timely warning notices to the community, when appropriate.Reporting Hate CrimesA hate crime is any criminal act or attempted criminal act directed against a person(s), public agency or private institution based on the victimÅfs actual or perceived race, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or gender or because the agency or institution is identified or associated with a person or group of an identifiable race, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or gender. A hate crime includes an act that results in injury, however slight; a verbal threat of violence that apparently can be carried out; an act that results in property damage; and property damage or other criminal act(s) directed against a private or public agency.Crimes routinely classified as misdemeanors can be felonies if committed because of bigotry. A conviction cannot be based on speech alone, unless the speech itself threatens violence against a specific individual or group, and the defendant has the ability to carry out the threat. If you are the victim of or witness a hate crime, report it as soon as possible to the UC Riverside Police Department.Facilities and landscaping are maintained in a manner that minimizes hazardous conditions. UC Riverside Police Officers regularly patrol the campus and report malfunctioning lights and other unsafe physical conditions to the Physical Plant Department for correction. Other members of the University community are helpful when they report equipment problems to the UC Riverside Police Department or Physical Plant.University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students: "40.00 ÅgPOLICY ON USE OF UNIVERSITY PROPERTIESÅh is available through the University of California, Office of the President website http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710524/PACAOS-40.? Policies governing student affairs facilities are available on the Highlander Union Building website at http://www.highlanderunionbuilding.ucr.edu/EventScheduling/Pages/SchedulingPolicies.aspxThe University of California Police Department presents programs to inform the community about safety and security practices. These programs occur numerous times throughout the year and include new student orientations. For information regarding these programs please contact the Crime Prevention Unit at (951) 827-1597.? More information about programs and safety tips are available online at: http://police.ucr.edu/prevention.htmlThe Campus Safety Committee (CSC) is diverse group of University faculty, staff, administration, union representation, and other constituencies, chaired by the Director of Environmental Safety & Health. The committee meets monthly to discuss campus safety issues. The primary goal of the safety committee is to create and maintain a high level of interest and awareness in safety among all employees and to help provide a safe and healthy environment for our faculty, staff, students, and visitors. The safety committee is also a forum where any and all safety issues can be discussed. The safety committee makes recommendations for improvement in various safety related areas. For more information, visit http://safety.ucr.edu.It is well recognized that the prevention of crime provides the best measure of protection. Therefore, the UCPD operates as a proactive crime prevention unit that works closely with the members of the community to make UCR a safer place to work, live and learn.The Department provides and/or collaborates in presentations on topics such as personal safety, vehicle and residential security, office and equipment security, sexual assault prevention, and guidelines for how to respond to a crisis. Brochures and literature on crime prevention and personal safety are available through the department's investigations/crime prevention office.In order to increase the level of crime awareness and campus safety at UCR , incidents of criminal activity within the campus community are publicized in many ways: distribution of the UCPD Annual Report and Crime Statistics; maintenance of an ongoing "press log;" dissemination of Community Crime Alert Bulletins (posters and mass e-mail notification); the "Rap Sheet" column in the Highlander student newspaper; articles in the weekly UCReport; "Crime Watch" columns in the campus housing newsletters; via regular police activity reports to campus housing administrators; and through crime prevention programs.In recent years UCR has experienced growth in the programs that target safety and security. For example, lighting has been improved at many locations around the campus, and several new Emergency Call Boxes (ECBs) have been installed and placed into service. In 2008 UCR implemented use of the Everbridge system to provide the community with alerts and updates on safety related incidents. Community members can sign up to receive notifications via text message, land line telephone, and e-mail. For more information and to sign up, please follow this link: http://cnc.ucr.edu/ens.? It is anticipated that as the population of UCR increases, so will the personnel, support services and programs designated for safety and security on the campus.UC Riverside provides housing to approximately 21,000 students, from apartments designed for students with children to multi-student apartment complexes and residential buildings. The UC Riverside Police, Student Housing staff, and apartment managers for on-campus private housing work closely together to create a safer and more comfortable living and learning environment. The security of residential areas involves on-duty residence hall staff, apartment managers, Community Service Officers and round-the-clock UC Riverside Police patrols. To provide residents with timely notice of major crimes or threats to the campus, Student Housing staff and apartment managers promptly post all Crime Alert Bulletins.Although all residence halls are accessible only by key/card key 24 hours a day, residents must also take an active role to ensure their own security. Always use common sense, and learn and follow campus security procedures. In addition, since the campus is open, and visitors to residence halls and apartments are not restricted or monitored, residents need to be alert and aware of their surroundings.To maintain the safety and security of residence halls, residents and visitors must ensure that locked buildings stay closed and locked. Keep your room or apartment door locked, always carry your key, take precautions to protect your keys against theft or loss, and report immediately any theft/loss of your building or room keys. In addition, do not open the door for unknown persons, and alert residence hall staff and the UC Riverside Police if you notice improper entry (someone climbing over a fence) or suspicious activity (a stranger leaving your friend's room carrying his or her computer).Our campus has over 264 buildings comprising almost 3 million square feet. Burglars or others intent on crime may target these structures. Although most buildings can be accessed by key after business hours, many are locked and alarmed after 5 p.m. It is essential that staff, faculty, and students cooperate to keep closed facilities locked. To prevent unauthorized entrance to campus buildings, DO NOT prop doors open, leave doors unlocked, or open the door for people you do not know. In addition, protect the security of campus keys, and report immediately any loss or theft of keys.UC Riverside takes the safety and welfare of our students very seriously. To that end, each student living in a campus housing facility has the opportunity to register the name and contact information of a person he or she would like notified if the student is found to be missing and cannot be located through reasonable outreach and investigation. Missing person contact information is registered confidentially and is accessible only to authorized campus officials in furtherance of a missing person investigation. Housing authorities will notify UC Riverside Police in the event of any resident student who is discovered to be missing.The University Police Department will take any missing persons report which is reported to them without delay regardless of jurisdiction. A missing person report will be given investigative priority over non-emergency property crimes.When an officer receives a report of a missing person, the officer will determine the category of missing person and complete a report. The reporting officer will ensure that the appropriate information is entered into the California and National Missing Persons data base. If the missing person is a student; the reporting UC Riverside Police Officer will also ensure notification is made to the studentÅfs emergency contact, if available, within 24 hours of the initial report. If the missing person is under 18 and not emancipated, UC Riverside Police will notify a custodial parent or guardian.If those suspected of committing a crime are University students, staff or faculty members, you may, in addition to filing a police report, report the suspected misconduct for possible disciplinary action.To report suspected misconduct by a UC Riverside student, call or email the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity Office 951-827-4208 or conduct@ucr.edu. University of California Standards of Conduct for Students prohibit physical assault, including sexual assault; threats of violence; and conduct that threatens health or safety, sexual harassment; stalking; illegal use or possession of weapons, explosives, drugs or alcohol; theft; vandalism; misuse of computer resources; and other crimes and misconduct. Students who commit crimes may be prosecuted criminally as well as disciplined by the campus. Students and student organizations may be disciplined for off-campus conduct that threatens health, safety or security.If a formal student disciplinary hearing is held, both the alleged victim and the accused have the same rights to be present at the hearing, and both have the same right to be accompanied by an advisor at any stage of the process. If the incident involved an alleged crime of violence or an alleged sex offense, both the alleged victim and the accused student are notified of the final decision in the disciplinary proceeding and any sanctions imposed. If the victim is deceased as a result of the crime, the disclosure will be made, upon request, to the victimÅfs next of kin. A finding that the violation was intentional, forcible, violent, or motivated by hatred or bias normally results in a sanction of Suspension or Dismissal.To report suspected misconduct by a UC Riverside student organization, contact the Office of Student Affairs at 951-827-4641.UC Riverside staff or faculty members may be subject to disciplinary action under applicable personnel policies or collective bargaining agreements. Questions about or reports of alleged staff misconduct may be directed to UC Riverside Human Resources, 951-827-6493see http://hr.ucr.edu/supervisor/labor.html.Alleged faculty misconduct may be reported to the Office of the Vice-Provost--Academic Affairs, 951-827-2304 (see http://academicpersonnel.ucr.edu/ )The University of California monitors criminal activity by students at off campus locations of student organizations officially recognized by the University, including student organizations with off campus housing facilities.

As defined under California law, rape is a non-consensual sexual intercourse that involves the use of force, violence, duress, menace or immediate and unlawful bodily injury, or if the person is incapable of giving consent because he/she is incapacitated from alcohol and/or drugs, or if a mental disorder or developmental or physical disability renders the victim incapable of giving consent. To be consensual there must be 'positive cooperation' and 'the person must act freely and voluntarily' (Penal Code 261.6). Whether the perpetrator is a stranger, acquaintance or friend is irrelevant to the legal definition of rape. According to Education Code 67385(d), sexual assault includes, but is not limited to, rape, forced sodomy, forced oral copulation, rape by a foreign object, sexual battery, or threat of sexual assault.""A student who is charged with committing a sexual assault can be prosecuted under California criminal statues, disciplined under the campus Student Discipline Procedures, and/or be the subject of a civil suit."If you believe that you have been sexually assaulted you have several options:Should you choose to pursue formal action through the campus disciplinary process, you as the survivor will have the following rights:Procedures for campus disciplinary action in case of an alleged sex offense:"This protocol is developed in order to assist sexual assault survivors with treatment, counseling and referral, and is not intended as an investigative process pursuant to initiating legal or disciplinary sanctions.

Any unwanted sexual contact or sexual attention committed by force, fear, duress, menace, trick or violence is sexual assault. It includes rape, attempted rape, spousal rape, oral copulation, sodomy, sexual battery, and insertion of a foreign object (finger(s) are considered a foreign object).The California Penal defines rape as non-consensual sexual intercourse accomplished through force or threat of force or when a person is unable to consent due to mental disorder, disability, drugs or alcohol.Rape is not an intimate relationship. Rape is a crime of violence, anger, and power. Rape is a crime that controls, humiliates and hurts the victim. A rapist can be anyone: acquaintance, boyfriend, ex-partner, classmate, family member, or co-worker. Any unwanted sexual act that is committed or at- tempted against a person's will is against the law and university policy.Sexual assault of any type is never the victim's fault.Talk to someone you trust to get the practical and emotional support you need.Seeking medical attention is important! Whether you choose to report the assault or not to report the assault, your well-being is the number one priority. A medical examination will treat physical problems, and may diminish fears about injury, sexually transmitted diseases, or possible pregnancy. If you decided to report the assault to the police, a medical examination must take place within 72 hours of the assault (depending on circumstances) to document collect physical evidence. You will be instructed to not destroy evidence by bathing, douching, changing clothes, or cleaning up in anyway. The State of California pays for any medical testing that is necessary for evidence collection.You have the right not to report the crime that was committed against you. Survivors who report their crime tend to feel emotionally stronger by taking action to help campus officials and law enforcement in University disciplinary procedures, or the possible arrest and criminal prosecution of their attacker. Reporting the crime may prevent another attack on you or someone else. The decision to tell someone about the crime may be difficult, but the decision is yours.Reporting options to consider:Contact the University Police Department or the Riverside Police Department (if the incident is off campus) for immediate protection and assistance.

After submitting your formal complaint, within five working days you will be notified of an interview.If you need assistance in reporting (formal or informal) you may contact the Title IX/Sexual Harassment Office at (951) 827-7070.The Title IX/Sexual Harassment Coordinator will help you explore your options.Note: While safeguarding your right to confidentially if you choose to disclose the name of the perpetrator to any University employee who is not a medical or counseling professional, she/he is obligated to follow-up on your report.
