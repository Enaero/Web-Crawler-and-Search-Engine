Now approaching its semicentennial, the Sweeney Art Gallery, a facility of UCR ARTSblock, is an artistic laboratory engaging diverse audiences with programs committed to experimentation, innovation, and exploration of art in our time. Sweeney Gallery develops and presents exhibitions of contemporary and historic works of art each year. It also provides interpretation, preservation, and collection of works of art; produces publications, symposia, lectures, and other events; serves as a laboratory for training future museum and other art professionals; and hosts the annual senior thesis exhibition for students in the Department of Art. In the last five years the Sweeney has grown into a nationally significant arts venue garnering attention for such shows as the west coast premiere of Sirens of Chrome by New York-based Danish artist Jesper Just in winter 2012. The Sweeney Art Gallery is located in the Culver Center and its shows frequently spill over into the Culver Atrium. These two venues recently hosted Margarita Cabrera's first solo museum exhibition on the west coast, Margarita Cabrera: Pulso y Martillo (Pulse and Hammer) as well as The Great Picture: The World's Largest Photograph. This photo's mammoth scale of 32 x 111 feet earned it a place in the Guinness World Records, and made it a photo history landmark. The Sweeney Art Gallery has been warmly supported by Marilyn and Jack Sweeney. You have reached this page during a time of renovation and reconstruction of the web site.
