Search for:Facilitated by Dr. Allan Muth, director, Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Center, University of California, Riverside, in partnership with UCR Palm Desert and The Living Desert. These free lectures, always held on the second Thursday of the month, are open to the public.Turtles and tortoises are one of the most threatened groups of animals on the planet, with more than half of all turtle species at risk of extinction. This is a global phenomenon and while the usual suspects of habitat degradation and environmental change contribute to the problem, the biggest threat to many species are human consumption and exploitation. Taylor Edwards, assistant staff scientist at the University of Arizona, will explore the threats to turtles globally and what scientists are doing to save them. RSVP now!This examination of how marine animals can be used to get a better look at the environment will be presented by Dr. Dan Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California Santa Cruz. Such studies offer a better view of the animals' ecology as well as a better understanding of the physical environment, while offering implications to the study of climate change. RSVP now!Renewable energy development is experiencing a renaissance, particularly in the southwest deserts of the United States, where wind and solar energy potential is high. Dr. Jeffrey E. Lovich of the U.S. Geological Survey, Southwest Biological Science Center, will discuss recent surveys evaluating the effects of wind/solar facilities on wildlife.The exchange of genes between plant populations by seed, pollen or plants can have important evolutionary and applied consequences. But plant geneticists had dismissed such gene migration as too insignificant to have any impact ? until Dr. Norman Ellstrand came along. Ellstrand, UCR professors of genetics in the department of botany and plant sciences, will discuss how his research radically challenged that view and how he applied what he found to answer questions about the risks of genetically engineered plants.What can we learn from hummingbird song? The study of bird song has given us a richer understanding of the evolution of communication, the nature of human language and mind, and the impact of technology on the natural world. Dr. Anne Houtman, dean of the school of natural sciences, mathematics and engineering at California State University Bakersfield, will look at how hummingbirds' little-studied song offers insight into these matters.The University of California has been active in the Coachella Valley for nearly 100 years, initially supporting the agriculture industry and more recently impacting modern growth issues through research in areas such as transportation, air quality, health, and habitat conservation. The UCR Palm Desert Center, established in 2005, serves as a base for UCRÅfs teaching and research in the desert, providing graduate education to the Coachella Valley through its innovative Master of Fine Arts Low Residency Creative Writing program, continuing education opportunities, and quality public lectures and programs in the arts, humanities and sciences.
