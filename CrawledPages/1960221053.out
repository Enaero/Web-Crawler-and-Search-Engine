Search for:?As one of very few Nematology Departments, we have drawn upon expertise from seven countries to build a diverse faculty of nine, addressing nematology research, teaching, and outreach in relation to agriculture, biology, genetics, systematics, ecology, evolution, and parasitology. Our continuing ties with the Agricultural Experiment Station are reflected by our particular strengths in developing environmentally sound nematode management practices including resistance, cultural practices and biological and chemical control. Our faculty interact across departments and programs to provide an abundance of opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training as well as a welcoming stimulating environment for visiting scientists. Whether you're a web surfer, colleague, or prospective graduate student, we are eager to share, through these pages, a sense of our enthusiasm for the work of our department and for the exciting field of Nematology.
