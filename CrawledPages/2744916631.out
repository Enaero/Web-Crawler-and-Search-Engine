In the CE-CERT Hydrogasification Laboratory, researchers are investigating ways to create high yields of ethanol from agricultural and forestry residues, municipal solid waste, and low cost grasses and wood.Having great people is only part of the equation. UC Riverside's researchers have access to state of the art equipment and technology, which allows them to always be on the cutting edge of exploration.Through Research and Economic Development and the dedicated work of faculty and student researchers in the pursuit of new knowledge, UC Riverside is fulfilling its role as the research university of Inland Southern California.The university's research heritage, our resources and our location make it an ideal place for exploring air, water, energy, biodiversity, sustainability, land use, the habitat/agriculture interface and much more.What we do and study here makes a difference to people every day: Every orange, lemon, lime and tangerine found on your grocerÅfs shelf has a genetic connection to the trees at our Citrus Research Collection. Our scientists have earned worldwide recognition for their expertise and breakthrough findings in the areas of plant sciences, environmental and natural resources and pest management.Our recent research innovations include:For over 100 years, UCR has been instrumental in the improvement of citrus production.
