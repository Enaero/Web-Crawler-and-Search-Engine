The California Citrus Clonal Protection Program (CCPP) in the Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology at the University of California, Riverside is a cooperative program with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the citrus industry of the state of California as represented by the California Citrus Nursery Board (CCNB) and the Citrus Research Board (CRB). The purpose of the CCPP is to provide a safe mechanism for the introduction into California of citrus germplasm for research, variety improvement, or for use by the commercial industry of the state. This mechanism includes, disease diagnosis and pathogen elimination followed by maintenance and distribution of true-to-type, primary citrus propagative material.?CCPP Information Brochure download?Event Calendar2014 CCPP Foundation Block Walkthrough is coming??BUDWOOD CUTTING DATES????
