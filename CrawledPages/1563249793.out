Mission Statement????????????????????????It is the mission of the Healthy Families Project to understand how children are taught health beliefs and behaviors by their parents, within their social and cultural environments.? We strive to conduct quality research that will dispel existing stereotypes and biases which limit current understanding, and provide novel and important contributions to the social sciences.? This will be accomplished in an atmosphere of openness and respect where all individuals, whether project members or participating family members, know their contributions are valued and can share without intimidation. Furthermore, we are committed to building relationships with the communities in which our participating families live and work, and to disseminating what we learn to those people who can and do influence childrenÅfs health.??
