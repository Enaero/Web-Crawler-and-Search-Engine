We are also proud to introduce our new Five-Year Joint B.S.+M.S. degree in Computer Science, the Five-Year Joint B.S.+M.S. degree in Computer Engineering and the M.S. degree in Computer Engineering. We have strong research programs in architecture, compilers, embedded systems, algorithms, computational biology, databases, data mining, computer networks, distributed processing, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and graphics.CSE students at UCR enjoy the benefits of a smaller campus, which include a more relaxed and personal atmosphere with specialized attention and guidance. In addition, our students can also take advantage of the innovative research, first-rate professors, and worldwide networking that comes from being part of the prestigious UC System. Our department currently has five lecturers and 23 tenure-track faculty that include three ACM Fellows, four IEEE Fellows, five AAAS Fellows, one Fellow of AAAI, one NSF Presidential Young Investigator, one AFOSR Young Investigator, and ten NSF CAREER award holders. Although relatively young, we have quickly become a well-established and well known research department, with 194 graduate students (61 M.S. and 133 Ph.D.) enrolled in the 2013-14 academic year. We graduate more than 20 Ph.D. students per year and place them in highly respected organizations. Our new external grants for 2013-14 academic year exceeds $10,000,000.The Department is pleased to announce a significant increase in the ranking of our program from such organizations as the National Research Council (NRC), Princeton Review, and U.S. News & World Report. Ph.Ds.org showed an independent analysis of the NRC data and rated us very high as well. We anticipate an increase in student applications from prospective graduates utilizing this information and are looking forward to a successful recruiting season.I invite you to further explore our department and the exciting opportunities that we provide on our web site and again, welcome you to Computer Science and Engineering at UCR!Laxmi N. Bhuyan Distinguished Professor and Chair, CSE Department???CSE's Yanping Chen will develop an inexpensive and robust sensor to directly measure the real-time density of insect vectors that transmit parasitic diseases to help plan intervention and treatment programs. Preliminary results indicate that insects can be classified based on the frequency of their wingbeats, which also varies depending on the time of day. Chen will develop an accurate detection system by investigating combining wingbeat frequency with circadian rhythms and other behaviors.?Congratulations to Jilong Kuang (PhD 2011; Advisor: Prof. Laxmi Bhuyan) for winning the Gold Medal in the software research field at the Samsung Best Paper Award 2013. His paper "Absolute Zero-Copy Web-Object Cache Design for High-Performance Cloud Deployments", co-authored by Daniel G. Waddington and Juan A. Colmenares, was selected as the Best Paper in the software field among about 350 submissions from all Samsung branches, and it is one of the 9 Gold-Medal winners out of over 1,700 submissions in different technical fields.Professors Srikanth Krishnamurthy, Iulian Neamtiu and Harsha Madhyastha are co-principal investigators in a collaborative research alliance on cyber-security with the U.S. Army Research Laboratories and four other universities. Penn State is the leading university for the effort. The research alliance is supported by $ 23.2 million in funding for the first five years, with an additional $ 25 million for an optional five-year extension -- a potential total of $ 48.2 million for a possible 10 year collaborative effort. The PIs from UCR will receive $ 3.7 million over the first five years, with potentially an additional 3.8 million over the following five years.The 13th International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases (SSTD'13) recognized the CSE team's work as Best Paper Award! The award goes to CSE's Roger Moussalli, Marcos Vieira, Walid Najjar and Vassilis Tsotras for their paper "Stream-Mode FPGA Acceleration of Complex Pattern Trajectory Querying". The paper demonstrated the mining of complex trajectory patterns from spatio-temporal streams at rates of GB/s, a feat previously thought of as unattainable using traditional Von Neumann computing for the application at hand. Have a look at the paper here: Paper Link (pdf).CSE's Eamonn Keogh received the 2012-13 Dissertation Mentor Award this year. This award is given only to one person in UCR every year. Eamonn was selected among all nominees to be awarded the sole 2012-2013 Dissertation Mentor Award. Professor Keogh's students past and present wrote with great enthusiasm in support of his nomination, citing his dedication to each individual student's success. This is a well-deserved award. Notably, CSE's Rajiv Gupta also received the award last year and so it is a great honor for the department to be awarded two years in a row. Congratulations Eamonn! We are all very proud of you.CSE faculty Victor Zordan and co-authors receive "Best Paper" Award at the ACM Siggraph/Eurographics Symposium on Computer Animation 2013. The paper, entitled "Control of Rotational Dynamics for Ground Behaviors" is ground-breaking research for physically driven motion in games and entertainment as well as having implication for robotics and beyond. The paper's novel idea for control over rotation for an articulated system earned the award for the international team of researchers from University of California Riverside, National University of Singapore and University of British Columbia. For a copy of the paper, check out Zordan's website.CSE Professor Iulian Neamtiu was acknowledged with a Bravo Zulu Award by Student Special Services University of California, Riverside. He was recognized for his strong participation in the UCR Veterans Support Team, as well as his exceptional support of student veterans and veterans' issues. This year marks the first-ever "Bravo Zulu" Award to recognize staff, faculty, and departments for their outstanding service to student veterans, and a job well done. Dr. Neamtiu is the first recipient of this honorable award. ?Way to go Iulian!Dr. Eamonn Keogh has just become the (joint) most prolific author in the top data mining journal, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery. His paper entitled "CID: An Efficient Complexity-Invariant Distance for Time Series" is his eleventh paper to appear in the journal. The only other author with eleven papers is Jiawei Han, who got his Phd sixteen years earlier than Dr. Keogh. Dr. Keogh noted "it is a very interesting paper, because the entire contribution can be written as a single line of Matlab code. Having said that, we did more experiments in that another paper in this area to convince the reviewers of the utility of this work."CSE proudly presents its first offering of CS 010V -- a fully-online equivalent to CS 010. Much more than video lectures on the web, the course uses new interactive animated web content to guide students step-by-step through the learning process, and includes state-of-the-art online homework and programming assignment feedback systems, plus plenty of online live interaction with the instructor, TAs, and other helpers.
